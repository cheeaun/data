Abstract of the talk(s) given by respective speakers News Bytes  It will cover the latest news on information security that were in headlines in last month.  Understanding the Microsoft Office 2013 Protected-View Sandbox by Yong Chuan Koh Sandboxing is a popular modern technique used by vendors to minimize the damages that attackers might inflict on a compromised system by restricting the application’s trust boundaries. Sandboxing raises the bar for exploitation because the compromised application is now “contained”, and typically need at least another vulnerability to escape the sandbox container to achieve the same level of system compromise. As a testament of its effectiveness, popular applications that have adopted sandboxing technique include Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Adobe Reader. Microsoft Office is no exception; its sandbox is implemented as the Protected-View feature since Office 2010. At present, there are many excellent sandbox researches for Chrome, Internet Explorer Enhanced Protected Mode and Adobe Reader. However there is no similar research for the Microsoft Office Protected-View sandbox yet. This talk aims to bridge this gap. The first part of this talk will sketch the Protected-View sandbox internals by discussing about its architecture, its initialization sequence and the system resource restrictions. The second part will discuss the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism, including the mode of communication, undocumented objects involved, format of IPC messages and the semantics of selected IPC messages. Speaker(s) Bio: Yong Chuan is a security researcher in the MWR Labs. He mainly likes to find vulnerabilities and exploit them.
