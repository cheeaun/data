For the first time, we will use the PayPal office. Paypal has a really big conference room which can fit 100 people. So it's a great time to tell your friends about SingaSUG :). 1) Jorge Simao is the founder of JPalace . He will be doing a talk about transactions. Jorge lives in Portugal and will be in Singapore for a one-week consulting engagement. He will talk about best practices when doing transactions with Spring and Java. Jorge has been interviewed here . 2) Trong Dao Le is a Software Engineer at Quantcast. He has used both JMS and RabbitMQ in a very large-scale environment and will be providing feedback on that.

In January, Michał J Gajda, the author of hPDB ( http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hPDB ) is going to share his exciting new work: json-autotype to help Haskeller write Web Application API. Here is his description for the content of the talk. ====== There are huge APIs written entirely in JSON, and thus untyped, and unsafe to call. The traditional way to deal with this problem in strongly typed languages like Haskell, is not to examine untyped `Value` type provided by the parser, but rather write conversion functions for intended API types, and thus ensure type checking on a boundary between Web application and Haskell code. I propose to use an automatic tool json-autotype, to generate datatype declarations with Aeson's FromJSON instances from a set of example .json files. That greatly speeds up the process, and allows for very quick and well checked interfacing relatively large APIs. I will also explain the theory behind this tool.

Migrating packages.config to project.json for server packages, using bower instead of nuget to fetch client libraries, using grunt instead of build script to compile typescript and less and to run JavaScript unit test, setting up MVC, Web API and SignalR and using Kestrel to run the application on a Linux VM. - by Nyuyen Quy Hy • Dependency Injection with .NET MVC/WebAPI . Dependency injection is a powerful and fundamental software design pattern to building loosely coupled, highly unit testable software. Explore the 3 main ways of dependency injection (Constructor, Setter, Interface) and look at a simple and practical approach towards implementing IoC for any .NET MVC/WEB API project. - by Donovan Huang • Creating your own website using ASP.NET MVC 5 + AngularJS from 0 to go live .
