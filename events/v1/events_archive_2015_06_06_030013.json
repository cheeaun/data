NOTE: This is a different PayPal office from the last meetup! #1 Panel: Brining Big Data into an Organization: War Stories from People on the Front Lines (45 minutes, 15 minute Q&A) • Axel Winter, Global Head of Process & Data Architecture, Standard Chartered Bank • Chris Choy, Assistant VP of SmartHub at StarHub • John Berns, SVP, Head of Data Science at Lazada • Adam Drake, CTO, Skyscanner #2 Paypal: “Vertical Recommendation using Collaborative Filtering” (25 minutes, 5 minute Q&A) #3 Presto in the Cloud Presto is a fast SQL query engine from Facebook. In this talk, I will talk about our experience offering Presto as a Service on Amazon Web Services as part of Qubole Data Services. In our world, Presto clusters are ephemeral - they are instantiated on demand and remain operational as long as necessary and shutdown when not used. We will talk about autoscaling mechanisms that allow the cluster to scale up or down depending on the amount of work in the system - translating to cost savings. We will also talk about caching data in SSDs on new instance types that improves queries over frequently accessed regions of data. We will talk about how query performance improves considerably using the ORC format and present performance numbers to illustrate how Presto can be a great option for fast SQL execution in the cloud. About the speaker Hello there! I'm Siva Narayanan. In my current employment at Qubole, I strive to make Hadoop, Hive and Presto behave well in the cloud. Earlier, I worked on query processing and workload aspects in the Greenplum Parallel Database. I did my undergrad at BITS, Pilani, India and my Ph.D. in Computer Science at The Ohio State University.

In this class, we're going to bring you through your first steps in learning about Android App Development. Android is a Linux-based, open source mobile operating system developed by Google. Applications developed on Android are written in the Java programming language, and due to the open nature, anyone can develop Android apps! It currently holds the largest mobile market share, in front of Apple's. This workshop will provide a high level introduction to mobile app development, get participants started on the Android Studio platform (a tool for Android development), and walk participants through the development of their first Android app. By the end of this workshop participants will have created a basic Android application, and be equipped with the knowledge to start building more advanced apps. Tools you'll need to install/ bring along for the workshop: - Android Studio - Java Development Kit (JDK) - Laptop (Windows/Mac/Linux) - Android phone (Optional, we can loan you one if you don't have it but please indicate it to us!) - Phone to PC USB cable Good to have: Previous experience with Java or other object oriented programming language, but not required. Agenda: - Set up things like JDK, Android Studio, etc. - Introduction to mobile development - the rise of mobile and Android - Introduction to Android - little bit of history, delve into some fundamentals such as classes, activities, layouts, controls, events, manifest and more - Get writing some code! Our lead instructor this time is Laura Brandon . Laura is a software engineer from NEC and an avid innovator. Currently Singapore-based, she began her career in New Zealand and is pursuing her dream of working abroad. While she has spent the majority of her career working with facial and fingerprint recognition in global public safety applications, she also has experience researching and developing mobile, wearable, and augmented reality projects. Laura has created several Android applications including a human-to-dog matching app for Fox Network's star dog trainer, Cesar Millan and also augmented reality 'smart glasses' conducting facial recognition. She has run wearable computing workshops in Hong Kong, given talks on biometrics to New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and coached children in mobile application development.

This talk will briefly look into a secure development lifecycle before explaining fuzzing and the different techniques that can be applied. The talk concludes with some findings and statistics that have been collected over the time. • Breaking BYOD on Apple iOS by Vincent The global market for BYOD and enterprise mobility is expected to almost quadruple in size over the next four years, hitting $284 billion by 2019. BYOD software is used by some of the largest organizations and governments around the work. Barclays, AT&T, Vodafone, US DHS, US Army, Australian Department of Energy. BYOD software promises security for enterprises. It solves Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Network privacy, jailbreaking devices, but does it really? Nope, it doesn’t! For the past 4 months, I’ve been researching into these advanced functionality that applications are using. The result of my research is an approach to defeating BYOD and advanced iOS security mechanisms in an easy and effective manner. This talk will demonstrate not only how I’ve done it but will also include a tool / framework which was designed for that purpose. Speaker(s) Bio: Michael is a security consultant at SEC Consult. His main interest is towards the offensive realm of information security, particularly vulnerability research and exploit development. Vincent is working as senior security consultant at Vantage Point Security. He is a sharp, cold-blooded, highly focused hacker with a passion for advanced mobile exploitation executed with kiasu perfection. Singaporean by birth, Vincent defies the local stereotype of accepting ‘cannot’ for an answer and lives in a world of only pure possibility. Randen: is a software engineer having 12 years of experience in working on both Enterprise/Proprietary and Open Source Technologies. Currently he is more involve in developing API and mobile applications. He had been interested with security and applies it to how he is developing his applications.
