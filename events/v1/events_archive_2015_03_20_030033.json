The first will be about building developer communities by Winston Teo who has organized multiple meetups and conferences over the past several years for the Ruby community. The second talk will be about how Facebook is using Apache Thrift and it will be by Duy, a NUS alumni and an ex-Facebook intern. See you! p.s. There will be a Facebook swag giveaway! Venue: SR3, Town Plaza, UTown Free pizza is served before the talks. Building Developer Communities Talk description Developer Communities are awesome for learning, for exchange of ideas, for careers and for friendships. There are several online Developer Communities out there like GitHub and Stack Overflow but it's so important to have offline Developer Communities too, where people meet face to face over pizzas and drinks and put a face to an online handle. In this talk, I would talk about why, who and how to build a Developer Community through my experience running the RubySG community since 2012. Hopefully, you would be inspired too to participate / start your own Developer Community and help make the World a better place. Speaker profile Winston is an entrepreneur, advisor, full-stack engineer and a happy person at Jolly Good Code - a consultancy that specilises in Agile and Ruby. Besides doing his regular job of writing quality code, Winston also organizes Singapore's Ruby meetups, Rails Girls and the annual RedDotRubyConf. Sometimes, he speaks at Ruby conferences too - the most recent ones are RubyConf Philippines 2014, Oedo Ruby Kaigi 2014 and RubyConf Taiwan 2014. Occasionally, you might find him contributing to open source projects too. Apache Thrift at Facebook Talk description At Facebook, engineers prefer choosing the best tool and language available for the job over sticking with a single particular programming language. Thrift has been developed at Facebook to assist this development culture without sacrificing performance. This talk will serve as an introduction to Thrift, and how it can be used to decouple the large-scale system, and to make it easier to implement high-performance and cross-language services Speaker profile Duy is Facebook campus ambassador for AY2014-2015 who was interned in payment platform at Facebook last summer. He is currently working at Pear Comms as a backend engineer. He likes algorithms, systems and building developer tools.

Researchers from RIT (Rakuten Institute of Technology), including head of RIT Global will speak on their research work. Update: Strictly by registration, no walk-ins. Attendees will need to present a valid IC to the building security in order to receive an access pass. Agenda: Event starts at 7.15 pm. - Welcome by Ewa Szymanksa, heading RIT Singapore - RIT global overview by Masaya Mori, the founder of RIT - Case study by Youngjoo: Information retrieval – Finding food entity relationships using user-generated data in a Recipe Sharing Service Abstract: Rakuten recipe is a Japanese recipe site where users submit and share their recipes with other users. Since the contents are user-generated, the recipes often contain misspellings, abbreviations, synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. Identifying and normalizing these words is essential to retrieving relevant recipes according to user's search request. In this talk, Youngjoo will introduce a new approach to finding related words in a recipe domain using the data structure. Speakers’ bios: Youngjoo Chung is a lead scientist in RIT Tokyo. She joined RIT after receiving her Ph.D in Information science and Technology from University of Tokyo in 2011. Her research interests include information retrieval, data mining, outlier detection, and recommender systems.

MasterCard hackathon is taking place in Singapore on March 28-29. Use the code HackAngel for free tickets. http://bit.ly/mocsg The CONCEPT How is a truly gifted Coder (as in programmers, designers and developers) distinguished today? For thousands of years, master artisans were honored with an insignia in recognition of their talent. A distinct object such as a pin or hat established their dominance in a field. “Coders”, as we define them here, have become the world’s newest artisans. Just as master builders were essential for the creation of a business 400 years ago, Coders are needed for everything from website creation to server maintenance and developing new in-house platforms. Yet there is no identifying seal showcasing the quality of Coders, their rank amongst peers or even their trials and accomplishments. Enter the MasterCard Masters of Code Competition. Through this intense series of hackathons we have one goal: to traverse the globe and engage the very best Coders. Each regional hackathon will have developers, designers and entrepreneurs using the MasterCard APIs to create masterful prototypes that demonstrate artful coding and design skills, while articulating clear business cases. The competition will be intense and the tension high, but we are looking to create a different experience for our participants. Each event will be held in one of the most thriving tech communities worldwide – and at the best venues there. Winners from each region will be flown out for the Grand Finale Masters of Code Hackathon in Silicon Valley to experience a MasterCard Priceless Experience – Northern California. The final itself will be just like the regionals with up to ten teams from the region events and one MasterCard elite team of Coders. The winning team will be recognized as the first Masters of Code Champions and given their Masters of Code Jackets, $100,000 and many other perks. Only the global winning team will be given this honor and privilege. THE COMPETITION Regional Level: Each region has a specific Challenge, Featured API and Secret API that attendees can go after. While you don't have to use all three in your hack, bonus points will be awarded to those that do. The Singapore Challenge: Using Commerce/Payments to Empower Women The Singapore Featured API: Simplify Commerce The Singapore Secret API: Shh, you'll have to wait for the event to find that out... PRIZES Grand Prize* The MasterCard Masters of Code Champions will be crowned and will receive $100,000 to develop their innovation, in addition to the following prizes*: Two weeks on-site at the MasterCard Start Path™ accelerator location in Dublin, Ireland, or an alternate remote program Six months of mentoring from a member of the MasterCard Open API executive team and the Start Path program team Free payment processing for up to $250,000 in transactions for the first 12 months using Simplify Commerce**.. *Prizes may be modified to accommodate regional availability and regulations of the winning team location **Legal Disclaimer: To qualify for this promotion, a Masters of Code team must apply to become and be approved as a Simplify Commerce merchant and actively transact via Simplify Commerce Gateway. “Actively transact means conducting a sales transaction that results in Simplify Commerce making a deposit to the checking account you have linked to your Simplify Commerce merchant account. If you qualify, Simplify Commerce will rebate the 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction processing fee for your first $250,000 in sales that occurs within 12 months after the company becomes a Simplify Commerce merchant. Should a transaction be refunded, it will not be eligible for a rebate. After the company reaches $250,000 in sales, processing fees will remain 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction (or the standard rate at that time). Regional Winner Singapore Masters of Code Title: The first of it's kind. Place in the Grand Finale in Silicon Valley in December: The winning team will be flown to Silicon Valley to compete in the Grand Finale Masters of Code hackathon (up to 5 members) MasterCard Priceless® Experience in Napa Valley and San Francisco – while at the Grand Finale in December Regional Runner-Up Each regional runner-up team member will receive a $500 USD MasterCard gift card. RULES AND JUDGING CRITERIA Rules: Teams of up to 5 humans are allowed. You can also add 1 cyborg, Furby, drone, or Sphero. All team members must have completed the participation agreement to compete.
