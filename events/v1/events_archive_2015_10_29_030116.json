There are absolutely no fees. Just come with an open mind and willingness to share and learn Agenda:  Introduction &amp; Networking : 15 mins News Bytes : 15 mins Attacks and Defenses on SOHO routers (45 mins) by Lyon Yang.  Abstract of the talk(s): 1. News BytesIt will cover the latest news on information security that were in headlines in last month. 2. Attacks and Defenses on SOHO routers In this talk we will look into how a series of 0-day vulnerabilities can be used to hack into tens of thousands of SOHO Routers. We will elaborate on the techniques that were used in this research to locate exploitable routers, discover 0day vulnerabilities and successfully exploit them on both the MIPS and ARM platforms.  Speaker(s) Bio: Lyon Yang is a senior security consultant at Vantage Point Security with a research focus on embedded systems hacking and exploitation. He is from sunny Singapore, the world’s first smart city. His regular discoveries of zero days in a variety of router models has earned him a reputation as the go-to guy for router hacking in Singapore, where he has been hired to do firmware source code reviews on popular router models. He is currently working on a comprehensive testing framework for ARM and MIPS based routers as well as shell code generation and post-exploitation techniques.

We have come out with this special event with PayPal and invited Douglas to give a talk to the SingaporeJS community! Upgrading the Web  The web was originally imagined to be a simple distributed document retrieval system. It is now being used for applications that go far beyond the system's original capabilities and intentions. We have found ways to make it work, but they are difficult and far too fragile. Many times companies have offered to replace the web with superior proprietary systems, but we rejected them. We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying deficiencies, increasing instead of reducing its complexity. This talk suggests a way forward, taking inspiration from our successful transition from NTSC to HDTV. There is a way forward to a web that is safer, easier, and as good as we desire. Douglas Crockford is best known for his ongoing involvement in the development of the JavaScript language, for having popularized JSON, and for developing various JavaScript tools such as JSLint and JSMin. He is currently a senior JavaScript architect at PayPal, and is also a writer and speaker on JavaScript, JSON, and related web technologies.

There is some great content at learnchef.io which I have wanted to go through for a while but have yet to schedule in. So I am scheduling the time to do it.If you would like to Learn Chef too, join me for this Meetup. I cannot provide any expertise on Chef whatsoever, but I can provide a room with a big screen, food, uninterrupted time to watch the content and go through the labs as well as others to discuss with and expertise on DSC.If this sounds like something you'd like to do please come along, let's learn Chef and progress our journey to DevOps.","location":"Microsoft Singpaore, One Marina Boulevard, Level 21 Auditorum, Singapore 018989","url":"http://www.meetup.com/mssgug/events/225252780/","group_id":18429776,"group_name":"Microsoft User Groups (Singapore)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/mssgug","formatted_time":"14 Nov 2015, Sat, 10:00 am","start_time":"2015-11-14T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-11-14T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"701465489954066","name":"Making things Move","description":"Make things that twist, turn, pop and move.

These principles help reduce the cost, time and risk of delivering changes, and ultimately value, to customers by allowing for more incremental changes to applications in production. Continuous integration (CI) is the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. In the same vein, the practice of continuous delivery further extends CI by making sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed to users and makes the actual deployment process very rapid. So, in this rapid and fast world of CI-CD, focusing on highly scalable &amp; highly portable software landscape, which offers high usage oriented web apps, the security landscape has really reached to cutting edge point. This talk, will focus on how to posturize security with this fast pace world, covering most of all security verticals.
