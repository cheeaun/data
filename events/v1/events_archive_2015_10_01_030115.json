Here is a short synopsis of the session (there will be a hands-on portion so do bring along your laptops with the pre-req packages). And yes, there will be food. Synopsis:With the growing volume of digitized spatial information available, knowledge of spatial visualization and analysis will be extremely useful skills to have for a data scientist. In this session, we will share some basic spatial visualization and analysis using R based on some of the work we do. The focus will be on the use of Leaflet (for R), one of the powerful libraries for interactive visualization of spatial data. We will also briefly mention a few useful libraries for spatial analysis, and provide a few examples related to the work we do.To make the hands-on session smoother, you may wish to install the following R libraries, as well as the following data set: • Leaflet: devtools::install_github(\"rstudio/leaflet\") • rgdal (CRAN) • rgeos (CRAN) • Dengue data (select the SHP icon): http://data.gov.sg/Metadata/OneMapMetadata.aspx?id=DENGUE_CLUSTER&amp;mid=209760&amp;t=SPATIAL Speaker Bio:Chong Jie (CJ) joined the Nielsen Data Science Singapore Innovation group at the end of last year. Some projects he works on include:Store-matching,  Automation of stratification and sample selection,  Digital Advertisement Ratings, and e-Commerce. At Nielsen, he also had the opportunity to conceptualize and conduct an Introductory R course to provide a hands-on learning approach to associates who wish to pick up R.  Prior to joining Nielsen, CJ worked at the Ministry of Education (MOE) for 8 years, and in the last 4 years with MOE, he led a newly established Data Management Committee for a branch in the MOE headquarters, handling data maintenance, extraction and analysis for the branch.","location":"Microsoft Auditorium (Singapore), One Marina Boulevard, Level 21 Auditorium, Singapore 018989 ","url":"http://www.meetup.com/R-User-Group-SG/events/225671193/","group_id":1681073,"group_name":"R User Group - Singapore (RUGS)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/R-User-Group-SG","formatted_time":"14 Oct 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-10-14T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-14T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"225341569","name":"React Workshop (Basic)","description":"Build a ToDo list with React (or build something else if you are more adventurous).
