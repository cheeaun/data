So we are looking to build novel and practical applications on the seasonal haze situation that blankets Singapore every year. We are bringing together developers, bloggers, environmental organizations and media associations in an unprecedented civic hack to enhance our media reporting and response to the haze through the use of data. KEY OBJECTIVES Participants in the one-day haze-a-thon, on October 13, will be challenged to develop solutions, tools, widgets or apps that will enhance media reporting and citizen's responses to the haze. Proposed solutions could address some of the following challenges:  ●Forecast weather movements●Deliver objective, trustworthy PSI figures●Send timely alerts to residents●Help citizens to take adequate decisions and actions●Improve public education Please remember to sign up on Eventbrite here hazehack.eventbrite.sg  \n\n\nJOIN US FOR AFTER HACK SOCIAL DRINKS After the Hyper Haze Hack, join us for ONA's monthly social drinks just downstairs at The Bank Bar &amp; Bistro.

Here is a short synopsis of the session (there will be a hands-on portion so do bring along your laptops with the pre-req packages). And yes, there will be food. Synopsis:With the growing volume of digitized spatial information available, knowledge of spatial visualization and analysis will be extremely useful skills to have for a data scientist. In this session, we will share some basic spatial visualization and analysis using R based on some of the work we do. The focus will be on the use of Leaflet (for R), one of the powerful libraries for interactive visualization of spatial data. We will also briefly mention a few useful libraries for spatial analysis, and provide a few examples related to the work we do.To make the hands-on session smoother, you may wish to install the following R libraries, as well as the following data set: • Leaflet: devtools::install_github(\"rstudio/leaflet\") • rgdal (CRAN) • rgeos (CRAN) • Dengue data (select the SHP icon): http://data.gov.sg/Metadata/OneMapMetadata.aspx?id=DENGUE_CLUSTER&amp;mid=209760&amp;t=SPATIAL Speaker Bio:Chong Jie (CJ) joined the Nielsen Data Science Singapore Innovation group at the end of last year.
