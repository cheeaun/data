Clustering can be considered the most important unsupervised learning problem. The goal of clustering is to determine the intrinsic grouping in a set of unlabeled data. In this talk, Teck Por will be showing three clustering algorithms with iterative process: K-means clustering, EM clustering and kernel K-means clustering. After the introduction of the 3 popular clustering algorithms, he will also share his experience on fine tuning the parameters to address real problems, such as determine the number of clusters. Of course, in the end, the code walkthrough session will also give you an idea of how to apply these algorithms with R.

Clarence Tauro from CouchBase will be traveling to Singapore on that week and will be our guest speaker. We have interviewed Clarence here. Abstract NoSQL databases offer a significant change to how enterprise applications are built, challenging to two-decade hegemony of relational databases. The question people face is whether NoSQL databases are an appropriate choice, either for new projects or to introduce to existing projects. This talk will give a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency and polyglot persistence. It will then dive into Couchbase, which is a high-performance NoSQL distributed database with a flexible data model. Finally it will discuss how to integrate CouchBase with Spring using the Spring Data Couchbase project. ============================================ Note: if you are interested to go for CouchBase training in Singapore, all information is available here: http://training.couchbase.com/instructor-led-training/cd220-developing-couchbase-nosql-applications ","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/224470403/","group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1563358550577683","name":"ArtScience Late","description":"[TICKETS SOLD OUT!] Ryoji Ikeda: Supercodex Thursday 20 August, 8pm ArtScience Museum, Level 4 Concept, composition: Ryoji Ikeda Computer graphics, programming: Tomonaga Tokuyama PREPARE TO BE IMMERSED IN A MULTI-SENSORIAL EXTRAVAGANZA.

This time we will be discussing how we going to apply Virtual Reality technology to Advertising and Virtual Retail. Imagine the possibility of setting up storefront just like how we create websites like html now. So as, hire a virtual shopkeeper for your virtual storefront. Imagine the possibility to curate a virtual building of all the rooms, just like orchard road. Each room is a virtual shop in the building. Imagine the possibility to bring your possible customer to place or experience that you want them to experience to advertise your product. Such as taking your customer to taste a glimpse of Japan before showing them the Japan tour package. The $22tn retail industry is for us, the Virtual Reality Enthusiast to explore and set pace. Being able to simulate the real shopping experience whilst in the comfort of their own home is another big step from the present online shopping experiences. And for marketers looking to VR / AR as a way of delivering richer brand experiences, we’ll look at examples from Nissan, Castrol, Marriott Hotels, Dior and Patron. So let discuss and share about what can we, the VR Enthusiast brings to this market.
