No problem! This is a half day event for complete beginners. Using recorded content from the Microsoft Virtual Academy and demonstrations from a PowerShell MVP and the User Group Leads, you'll finish the day much more confident with PowerShell than you were before. We have been hearing from the Community that there are not enough sessions for Beginners, also, some people are not confident about using PowerShell because they haven't had a good enough grounding in the fundamentals. We would like to address that. What are we doing at this Meet Up? This meet up is intended for those who want to get started with the basics of PowerShell. As PowerShell is not a new technology, there are many really awesome resources out there to get started. As such, we don't believe it is worth re-inventing the wheel. One of the best resources out there are the Microsoft Virtual Academy courses by the inventor of PowerShell Jeffrey Snover and MVP Jason Helmick which take you through as much as you need to get started. In this meet up we will be screening much of the content from Getting Started with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start . This is an opportunity for those who have been interested in viewing this online but who haven't had time, or those who have watched it but are still a little unsure on some topics to go through it with us in an environment free of distractions. At the end of each module you'll be able to ask questions to clarify anything you're not sure of and we'll discuss, demo and bash keyboards until you feel you've mastered it! The day should follow along the lines of: • Welcome to the Session and set the scene - what is PowerShell, why so important and what are we doing here • Screen content from the MVA course, answer the quiz questions, do Q&A, any Demo's & further explanation • LUNCH! • Screen more videos • Wrap up and talk about what's next • Home Sweet Home All in all we will cover the Help System , the Pipeline , understanding Objects and Remoting . Having a sound grounding and solid understanding of these concepts will propel you forwards with your PowerShell Learning! Wait, why should I attend when I could watch this online?! Yes, you absolutely could watch this online in your own time, we believe the reasons to attend are: • To connect with like-minded people in the community that you don't connect with from behind your screen • Have the ability to ask questions when there is something you don't understand • Get a free lunch! • Have time and space free from the distractions of home or work to really concentrate, watch the material and learn it Is this a proper training event? Not really. User Groups should be seen as places to network and gather with like-minded folks and learn a little along the way. We don't make any commitment to turn you into experts and you only get out as much as you put in, but we commit to sharing our knowledge to help you improve and hope you will commit to sharing your knowledge with the group as well. So, what should I expect from this? Meet other PowerShell Enthusiasts. Be introduced to some great learning resources. To be given the time and distraction-free environment to learn from the Microsoft Virtual Academy. Lunch. How do I get the most from this? Bring your laptop - the best way to learn is by doing! Watch Video 1 from the Getting Started with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start course. Be on time. Ask questions and participate Please remember this is aimed at Complete Beginners and all content will be at that level, though Intermediate folks may learn some tips and tricks along the way also.

I decided to take a look and found it an impressive language that I am comfortable using, for a new production app in my company. Our current app uses golang for the API backend. I would like to share my experiences (and pain :-p) learning the language and why I am happy with it as our API backend for a new app. This session is a compressed learn-and-hands-on session with code examples.

The consistent strategic problem faced by law enforcement agencies globally is how to achieve the best results with limited resources.  This includes maintaining public order, reducing crime, or maintaining the current status quo with reduced resources. In order to solve these issues, we must discover the actionable predictors (such as time and weather) of different types of crime, specific to each location or place type (such as a neighborhood or nightclub), in order that resources are used to best effect. This talk examines preliminary results using the UK Police Crimes and Outcomes dataset from December 2010 to June 2014, which has a relatively large volume: more than 19 million crime and anti-social behavior incidents from 43 police forces ( please see http://data.police.uk/ ). \nFinally, this talk explains how smart policing is applicable to campus security. \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n FAQs \nWhere can I contact the organiser with any questions? \nPlease feel free to email ryanlbk@tp.edu.sg if you have any questions.","location":"Temasek Polytechnic Auditorium 2 & Foyer, , 21 Tampines Avenue 1, Singapore 529757","url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/e/tp-infotechday-2015-all-about-big-data-smart-solutions-iot-seminar-registration-16012532917?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Temasek Polytechnic School of Informatics & IT and Singapore Computer Society","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/7989857219/","formatted_time":"25 Mar 2015, Wed, 1:30 pm","start_time":"2015-03-25T05:30:00Z","end_time":"2015-03-25T10:30:00Z"},{"id":"16010703445","name":"ibidi: Cells in Focus - Seminar Series @ IMB","description":"Abstract \nHow to combine cell culture and cell based assays with high end microscopy   Long-term imaging of living cells is an increasingly important technique in cell biology.

From Silicon Valley to Silicon Straits, this humble material has become synonymous with high-tech enterprise driven by the ever increasing computation power and shrinking size of CMOS processors. However, transistors cannot simply keep getting smaller (the characteristic size of CMOS transistors is now only 60 atoms wide). At these scales, the bizarre laws of quantum mechanics come into play: electrons can be in two places at once (called ‘superposition), and can ‘tunnel’ through barriers. Controlling electrons at these scales becomes a bit like herding (Schrödinger) cats, making it impossible to build basic computing components. Chip designers today have been using all their ingenuity to fend off this ‘quantum limit’ for a few more years with novel designs, but reaching the limit is inevitable. Instead of trying to work around these troublesome quantum effects, it is possible to build an entirely new type of computer whose operation fundamentally relies on quantum features such as superposition. There are a wide range of different technologies being explored to build such a ‘quantum computer’, including arrays of trapped ions addressed by lasers, and circuits of superconducting aluminium kept a few thousands of a degree above absolute zero. Recent results from laboratories around the world suggest that silicon could in fact provide a platform for such quantum processors - this include superposition states that last for 3 hours, or being able to measure individual dopant atoms in silicon nano-devices. We still have a little way to go before silicon can be considered to be on an equal footing with other quantum computing designs, but this isn’t the first time silicon has played catch-up. After all, lead sulfide and germanium were used to make transistors before high-purity silicon and CMOS technology came along. So far, we have every reason to think that silicon will survive the next big computational leap, from the classical to the quantum age. \n  \nJohn Morton studies the coherent control of electron and nuclear spins in solid state materials and devices, with a focus on quantum technologies. Quantum technologies are ones which exploit quantum superposition and entanglement to achieve major advances over current technologies in areas including communication, sensing and information processing. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nThis event is organised by the Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore in partnership with the Science Centre Singapore.","location":"Science Centre Singapore, , 15 Science Centre Rd, Singapore 609081","url":"http://cqt.eventbrite.sg/?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/2560122282/","formatted_time":"25 Mar 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-03-25T11:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-03-25T12:30:00Z"},{"id":"809682475769370","name":"WordPress Meetup March 2015","description":"Looking for speakers, lightning talks, etc. Just ping Robert if you have anything to contribute. :)","location":"HackerspaceSG","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/809682475769370","group_name":"Singapore WordPress User Group","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/886098818070598","formatted_time":"25 Mar 2015, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-03-25T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-03-25T14:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"16011308254","name":"Seminar @ NTU SBS : ibidi – cells in focus: How to combine cell culture and cell based assays with high end microscopy","description":"Untitled Document \n \nAbstract \nLong-term imaging of living cells is an increasingly important technique in cell biology.

This time it'll be on the 26th of March at the ThoughtWorks' office. Venue: 87B Amoy Street #03/04, Singapore 069906, Singapore We're still looking for one more 10-15 minute talk, if you're interested please contact us! PyCon Singapore is going to be June 17th to 19th and the call for proposals is up on the website, if you have something to share then please sign up! https://pycon.sg/proposals/ -------------- Talks 1. \"Getting started with testing using Pytest and Mock\" by Gabe Hollombe. Pytest is a great alternative testing framework to unittest from the standard library. It often lets you get the same tests written with far fewer lines of code, and it has a cool dependency injection system to help you share common test dependencies while keeping your tests understandable. I'll tell you all about how to get basic unit testing done, and I'll show you how to use Voidspace's Mock library to test collaborations between your objects, too. Gabe is a full-stack senior engineer at Neo Innovation, with a thirst for knowledge and a passion for sharing what he's learned. He's had the pleasure of speaking on four different continents about JavaScript, Ruby, Vim, and HTML5 Game development. 2. \"Developing real time applications in Django with Websockets \" by Gerald Goh Utilising swampdragon , I'll be showing how to build a simple real time chat application in Django. Gerald is a full stack developer at Apvera Pte. Ltd., a security analytics startup. 3. \"Five Python tips\" by Martin Brochhaus We are hoping to repeat this talk with different speakers at the end of each meetup. Martin will make the start and give quick introductions to five Python tools that will make your life easier: * Virtualenv / pyenv * Tox * pip-tools * the @property decorator * Fabric Martin is the founder of Bitmazk Pte. Ltd., a Singapore based web development agency specialized on creating web apps with Python and Django. He is also part of the organizing committee for PyCon Singapore and an active member of Python User Group Singapore. 4. Alfred from PyCon APAC will talk about the upcoming APAC conference in Taiwan. -------------- Would you like to speak at this or a future meetups? You could share about your technology stack, how you solved a problem, your new library, or your opinions on best practices, so that people can get to know how awesome you are! 5 Python tips is a small segment at the end of meetup where you can share some things that make your Python life easier. A newly discovered core module, a library or some command line tool that makes your life better and/or easier. So don't be shy! Step forward and share your knowledge! For speaking please contact Björn, @gaqzi or <ba@sanitarium.se>, or Victor <icyisamu@gmail.com> See you all soon! -------------- Job Postings Are you looking for Pythonista?

MasterCard hackathon is taking place in Singapore on March 28-29. Use the code HackAngel for free tickets. http://bit.ly/mocsg The CONCEPT How is a truly gifted Coder (as in programmers, designers and developers) distinguished today? For thousands of years, master artisans were honored with an insignia in recognition of their talent. A distinct object such as a pin or hat established their dominance in a field. “Coders”, as we define them here, have become the world’s newest artisans. Just as master builders were essential for the creation of a business 400 years ago, Coders are needed for everything from website creation to server maintenance and developing new in-house platforms. Yet there is no identifying seal showcasing the quality of Coders, their rank amongst peers or even their trials and accomplishments. Enter the MasterCard Masters of Code Competition. Through this intense series of hackathons we have one goal: to traverse the globe and engage the very best Coders. Each regional hackathon will have developers, designers and entrepreneurs using the MasterCard APIs to create masterful prototypes that demonstrate artful coding and design skills, while articulating clear business cases. The competition will be intense and the tension high, but we are looking to create a different experience for our participants. Each event will be held in one of the most thriving tech communities worldwide – and at the best venues there. Winners from each region will be flown out for the Grand Finale Masters of Code Hackathon in Silicon Valley to experience a MasterCard Priceless Experience – Northern California. The final itself will be just like the regionals with up to ten teams from the region events and one MasterCard elite team of Coders. The winning team will be recognized as the first Masters of Code Champions and given their Masters of Code Jackets, $100,000 and many other perks. Only the global winning team will be given this honor and privilege. THE COMPETITION Regional Level: Each region has a specific Challenge, Featured API and Secret API that attendees can go after. While you don't have to use all three in your hack, bonus points will be awarded to those that do. The Singapore Challenge: Using Commerce/Payments to Empower Women The Singapore Featured API: Simplify Commerce The Singapore Secret API: Shh, you'll have to wait for the event to find that out... PRIZES Grand Prize* The MasterCard Masters of Code Champions will be crowned and will receive $100,000 to develop their innovation, in addition to the following prizes*: Two weeks on-site at the MasterCard Start Path™ accelerator location in Dublin, Ireland, or an alternate remote program Six months of mentoring from a member of the MasterCard Open API executive team and the Start Path program team Free payment processing for up to $250,000 in transactions for the first 12 months using Simplify Commerce**.. *Prizes may be modified to accommodate regional availability and regulations of the winning team location **Legal Disclaimer: To qualify for this promotion, a Masters of Code team must apply to become and be approved as a Simplify Commerce merchant and actively transact via Simplify Commerce Gateway. “Actively transact means conducting a sales transaction that results in Simplify Commerce making a deposit to the checking account you have linked to your Simplify Commerce merchant account. If you qualify, Simplify Commerce will rebate the 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction processing fee for your first $250,000 in sales that occurs within 12 months after the company becomes a Simplify Commerce merchant. Should a transaction be refunded, it will not be eligible for a rebate. After the company reaches $250,000 in sales, processing fees will remain 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction (or the standard rate at that time). Regional Winner Singapore Masters of Code Title: The first of it's kind. Place in the Grand Finale in Silicon Valley in December: The winning team will be flown to Silicon Valley to compete in the Grand Finale Masters of Code hackathon (up to 5 members) MasterCard Priceless® Experience in Napa Valley and San Francisco – while at the Grand Finale in December Regional Runner-Up Each regional runner-up team member will receive a $500 USD MasterCard gift card. RULES AND JUDGING CRITERIA Rules: Teams of up to 5 humans are allowed. You can also add 1 cyborg, Furby, drone, or Sphero. All team members must have completed the participation agreement to compete.
