Come join us for a weekend of working with data to do good! RSVP to work alongside experts in the field to analyze, visualize, and mash-up the data from our non-profit partners. If we don't know you already, please tell us a bit more about yourself by filling in this Google form ! Non-Profit Organizations 1) Earth Hour World Wildlife Fund ’s Earth Hour is a global environmental movement with a core vision to create environmental impact by utilizing the power of the crowd. Started seven years ago, Earth Hour has grown to become the world’s largest mass participation event in history: celebrated in over 7,000 cities, across 7 continents and by hundreds of millions of people. Earth Hour recently took place around the world on 28 Mar 2015 (Sat, 8.30 - 9.30 pm). 2) Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME) Founded in 2004, the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) serves the needs of the migrant worker community in Singapore by developing research and education on the socioeconomics of migration in Singapore and the countries of origin, providing social integration services for emigrants and immigrants, and providing humanitarian assistance for the effects of 'crisis' migration. There are more than 1.3 million documented migrant workers or more in Singapore, of which about 1.1 million are low-wage workers. HOME has provided services to more than 50,000 migrant workers through its provision of shelters, legal assistance, health education training and rehabilitative services. Special thanks to Fuji Xerox Singapore for being our venue sponsor! Schedule Friday, Apr 24th 7.15 pm: Doors open, sign-in (we're on the 4th floor!) 7.45 pm: Introduction to Non-Profit Organizations and Datasets 8.15 pm: Pitching for teams 8.30 pm: Formation of teams It's a great chance to learn about the non-profits and their data, meet the other volunteers you'll be working and talk with others from our partner causes. Plus, there will be snacks and drinks! Saturday, Apr 25th 9 am: Doors open, sign-in and breakfast 9.30 am: Brief review from Data Ambassadors, then data diving! 12.30 pm: Lunch 1 pm: Open Roundtables 6 pm: Dinner 9 pm: Everybody goes home for the night Saturday we'll start work on the data! DataDivers will choose which problems they'd like to work on and form teams around their individual questions. There will be roving DataKind project team leads who will help advise on and manage the projects throughout the day. Sunday, Apr 26th 9 am: Doors open, breakfast 12 noon: Presentations from teams to social organizations 2 pm: Another successful DataDive in the books! This is your chance to show the world what you have done with data! There is no expectation of slides or other presentation materials, simply use whatever method of conveying your work to the organizations you feel is best. This is also the chance for our non-profit partners to better understand what your team did. These presentations can be single or group work, but they can be no longer than 10 minutes each. We want to give everyone a chance to speak, and get people out at a reasonable time. Other items of note for the weekend Volunteers at all levels are welcome throughout the weekend . If you're already a pro, we're looking for some subject-area experts to help with project preparation and be resources throughout the DataDive. Unlike a hackathon, the goal is not (necessarily) to create an app, and it is not a competition. Instead, the objective is to work with teams of experts to understand a truly difficult problem through data. You could end up with a visualization, an analysis, some graphs, or even just some new datasets by the end of the event, and all of those are fantastic results! There is a Github repository setup to use for sharing code and analyses during the event . This will be our primary resource for capturing everything developed at the DataDive, so please use it for sharing and collaboration. We do not assign you to a problem . We want you to work with the problem and data you feel most passionate about, so come Friday with an open mind and be ready to learn. You do not have to stay the entire weekend to participate in the event . We hope that you will find a project you can dig into, but you are always welcome to come and go as you please. You do not have to work on the same project for the whole weekend . Again, we hope that you will find a project to work on to completion, but if at any point you feel like you want to change simply let the DataKind project team lead for your team know. We do not provide any hardware or software for you to use . We'll have the data and some services set up (hackpad, Github), but otherwise you should bring your own laptop and come ready to use whatever data tools you like. See you there!

Matt Brandwein, Director of Product Marketing at Cloudera will be speaking on Pervasive Analytics: Building a Data Strategy • How is data driving change? • Where are the opportunities, across industries? • What is required to gain value from data? • How can you get started today? Akmal B. Chaudhri will be speaking on \"Cutting through the NoSQL database hoopla and hype\" Today, there are thought to be over 150 commercial and open source NoSQL database products. Often, these products are divided into four broad categories: key-value stores, column stores, document stores and graph stores. Increasingly, some products are combining several of these categories together into what are called multi-model database systems. Whilst the market for NoSQL database systems today is still very small and thought to be around 2% of the SQL market, the technology has attracted interest from organizations looking to solve new business problems. However, since it is still an emerging technology, careful consideration is required in finding the relevant developer skills and choosing the right product. This presentation will discuss these issues in greater detail. In particular, it will focus on some of the leading NoSQL database products and discuss their architectures and suitability for different problems. Akmal's Bio: Akmal B. Chaudhri is an Independent Consultant, specializing in Big Data, NoSQL and NewSQL database technologies. He has over 25 years experience in IT and has previously held roles as a developer, consultant, product strategist and technical trainer. He has worked for several blue-chip companies, such as Reuters and IBM and also the Big Data startups Hortonworks (Hadoop) and DataStax (Cassandra NoSQL Database). He has worked extensively on worldwide developer relations programs at IBM and worldwide university relations and academic initiative programs at Informix and IBM. He has regularly presented at many international conferences and served on the program committees for a number of major conferences and workshops. He has published and presented widely on Java, XML and Database systems and edited or co-edited 10 books. He holds a BSc (1st Class Hons.) in Computing and Information Systems, MSc in Business Systems Analysis and Design and a PhD in Computer Science.

It was extracted out of the experiences of Bas Vodde and Craig Larman while Scaling Agile development in many different types of companies, products and industries over the last ten years. There are several case studies available and an upcoming book describing LeSS in detail. \nLeSS consists of the LeSS Principles, the Framework, the Guides and a set of experiments. The LeSS framework is divided into two frameworks: basic LeSS for 2-8 teams and LeSS Huge for 8+ teams. All of these are also available on the less.works website. \nLeSS is different with other scaling frameworks in the sense that it provides a very minimalistic framework that enables empiricism on a large-scale which enables the teams and organization to inspect-adapt their implementation based on their experiences and context. LeSS is based on the idea that providing too much rules, roles, artifacts and asking the organization to tailor it down is a fundamentally flawed approach and instead scaling frameworks should be minimalistic and allowing organizations to fill them in.","location":"Goodland Building, , 18 Roberts Lane #05-01, Singapore 218297","url":"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/more-with-less-and-introduction-to-large-scale-scrum-tickets-16512510363?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Bas Vodde","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/8082110503/","formatted_time":"05 May 2015, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-05-05T11:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-05-05T12:30:00Z"},{"id":"221882397","name":"AWS First Tuesday - May Meet up","description":"After a successful SG User Group meetup in April, I'm pleased to announce that we will be holding an 'AWS - First Tuesday' User Group meetup on 5th May 2015 here in the AWS Singapore office.

Attendees may sign in when they arrive and seats will be filled on a first-come-first-served basis. On 8 and 9 May 2015, ArtScience Museum will host a conference exploring the legacy of history's most celebrated artist and scientist, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). Most studies of da Vinci focus on a specific area of his activity - art, anatomy, technology, studies on water, on flight, and so on. This conference will offer a different point of view, encouraging an exploration of da Vinci's way of thinking and of the cultural landscape, which nurtured him. It will analyze how his interdisciplinary approach, which we now refer to as “systems thinking” and \"complexity\", remains strikingly resonant for us today, and applied within the fields of art, science, technology, architecture and foresight. The conference begins with a special edition of ArtScience Museum's monthly performance programme, ArtScience late (Thursday 7 May), and continues for two full days of discussions on 8-9 May, featuring presentations from within Singapore and around the world, from a range of leading speakers in the fields of science, history, technology, and architecture. The conference chairs are Honor Harger (ArtScience Museum) and Andrea Nanetti (Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design and Media and Complexity Institute). Thursday 7 May 2015 7.00 - 10.00pm: ArtScience Late with a special performance from TeZ, our international ArtScience resident. Friday 8 May 2015 10:00am - 7.00pm The first day of the conference presents da Vinci and the approach that he took to all of his lines of enquiries. It analyses how da Vinci not only understood the essence of ‘systems’ thinking, but how he also applied this to his inventions, ideas and work generally. We ask, was this approach extraordinary for its time? Was da Vinci different from his renowned contemporaries in this way? To address these questions, the keynote speaker, Professor Galluzzi will present an overview of da Vinci’s life, influences, influencers and projects in this context, and Professor Fiorani will explore the educational context of da Vinci’s time and place. We will explore if there was something within the context of da Vinci’s time which encouraged his thinking and ‘systems’ awareness, or was this a one-off – a spike in the linear progression of epistemology? We ask if there are there other examples of interdisciplinary thinking and approaches throughout history. The day will continue with a reflection on the more recent times and the advent of new media – a marriage of two seemingly quite separate, established disciplines: art and technology, moving the dialogue into the 20th century, and beyond. Saturday, 9 May 2015 10:00am - 7.00pm The whistle-stop tour through key ‘systems thinkers’ in history from the previous day, which ended with a look at innovation today in Singapore, continues with a day exploring contemporary ‘systems approaches’, specifically addressing the areas of: education and pedagogical methodologies today; and how science and technology can be applied broadly to work through some of the world’s most pressing issues. Fittingly, the last session looks to the future, and how ‘systems thinking’ is being successfully used to address environmental issues – perhaps the biggest threat to the continuing survival of the planet and its inhabitants.

For the first talk, Alex will be speaking about SVM. Here is a short overview of the talk, and a little bit about Alex too About SVM: SVM is nowadays one of the most popular classification algorithms. It is efficient in dealing big data set. It allows us to fit nonlinear classification boundary with kernel methods. Moreover, the combination of penalization and “customized” kernel enable us to introduce prior knowledge into classification. In this R share session, we will quickly go through the theoretical part of SVM, and demonstrate the application with R package “kernlab”. And last but not least, we will show 2 examples to let you feel the power of SVM. About Alex: I am a statistician in HSOR@NHG. I have been studying statistics for 6 years and using R for 6 years. My research areas are statistical learning, computing statistics, data visualization and data science with population health management.
