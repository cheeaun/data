Constraints boost creativity. First, let’s put constraints of no mutable state and no side­-effects on typical imperative code and see where creativity can bring you. Having reinvented referential transparency we proceed with lambda calculus – the theoretic foundation of functional programming. Expressions and recursive function definitions are means of flow control in the land of λ, so these we study next. Having defined several useful recursive functions we suddenly start seeing recurring patterns, which we call higher-­order functions. These prove themselves extremely powerful and you all of a sudden recognize them everywhere. At this point we will have a functional coding dojo just for fun. ","location":"ThoughtWorks office, 87B Amoy Street, Level 3, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/events/225698151/","group_id":12690122,"group_name":"Singapore Scala Programmers","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers","formatted_time":"06 Oct 2015, Tue, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-10-06T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-06T13:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"225644048","name":"Oct/2015 - Open Space (Metrics)","description":"Open Space Facilitator: Rohit Arora from Barclays Open Space Theme: Metrics Agenda 7:00pm - Networking and pizza 7:30pm - Topic generation 8:00pm - Breakout sessions 10:00pm - End We welcome contributions of drinks and snacks! =) What is Open Space?

Here is a short synopsis of the session (there will be a hands-on portion so do bring along your laptops with the pre-req packages). And yes, there will be food. Synopsis:With the growing volume of digitized spatial information available, knowledge of spatial visualization and analysis will be extremely useful skills to have for a data scientist. In this session, we will share some basic spatial visualization and analysis using R based on some of the work we do. The focus will be on the use of Leaflet (for R), one of the powerful libraries for interactive visualization of spatial data. We will also briefly mention a few useful libraries for spatial analysis, and provide a few examples related to the work we do.To make the hands-on session smoother, you may wish to install the following R libraries, as well as the following data set: • Leaflet: devtools::install_github(\"rstudio/leaflet\") • rgdal (CRAN) • rgeos (CRAN) • Dengue data (select the SHP icon): http://data.gov.sg/Metadata/OneMapMetadata.aspx?id=DENGUE_CLUSTER&amp;mid=209760&amp;t=SPATIAL Speaker Bio:Chong Jie (CJ) joined the Nielsen Data Science Singapore Innovation group at the end of last year.
