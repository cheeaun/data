Telling stories through data A journey in data visualization and digital storytelling Technology is changing the way that stories are being presented and told. At the same time, we're drowning in data and the need for clear, concise storytelling is greater than ever. All these data and technologies present opportunities to explore and reinvent how stories are being presented. Data visualization, data journalism, content games; all are aspects of how we can use UX + content/data to shape compelling narratives. We'll look at some data visualization examples and go through the design to answer questions. For example, for the past GE2015 election, which voting district in Singapore was the most politically apathetic? Which districts have the most spolit votes and why? Beyond the recent elections, we'll also look at other data visualizations and digital perspectives and how they relate to data science. Speaker Bio Chi-Loong suffers from an incurable disease called curse of the curious hybrid. He has a background in Computer Science, but somehow wandered into journalism, marketing and public relations. Past lives include mainstream and trade media, in-house and agency PR, energy and social media start-ups like Straits Times, British Telecoms and GolinHarris. The corporate world is not really suited for hybrids so he decided to forge out and co-found V/R (www.vslashr.com), a niche agency that blends art + science to tell stories through technology. \n\n\nDeep learning for stock market prediction It has been shown that news events influence the trends of stock price movements. However, previous work on news-driven stock market prediction rely on shallow features (such as bags-of-words, named entities and noun phrases), which do not capture structured entity-relation information, and hence cannot represent complete and exact events. Recent advances in Open Information Extraction (Open IE) techniques enable the extraction of structured events from web-scale data.  The speaker proposes to adapt Open IE technology for event-based stock price movement prediction, extracting structured events from large-scale public news without manual efforts. Both linear and nonlinear models are employed to empirically investigate the hidden and complex relationships between events and the stock market. Large- scale experiments show that event-based system out-performs bags-of-words-based baselines, and previously reported system strained on S&amp;P 500 stock historical data. The team further use deep learning to improve the representation of event for enhanced generalization, and to capture the influence of long-term and short-term historical events simultaneously. These techniques boost the accuracy of index prediction from 60% to 66%, and significantly enhance the accuracy of individual stock prediction. \n\n\n\nSpeaker Bio Yue Zhang is currently an assistant professor at Singapore University ofTechnology and Design. Before joining SUTD in July 2012, he worked as apostdoctoral research associate in University of Cambridge, UK. Yue Zhang received his DPhil and MSc degrees from University of Oxford, UK, and his BEng degree from Tsinghua University, China. His research interests include natural language processing, machine learning and artificial Intelligence. He has been working on statistical parsing, parsing, text synthesis, machine translation, sentiment analysis and stock market analysis intensively. Yue Zhang serves as the reviewer for top journals such as Computational Linguistics, Transaction of Association of Computational Linguistics and Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. He is also PC member for conferences such as ACL, COLING, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, AAAI and IJCAI. Recently, he was the area chairs of CLING 2014, NAACL 2015 and EMNLP 2015.

However things are now back on track and we have a meetup this month and we will also have a meetup earlier than usual in November as part of DevFest Singapore. The announcement for that will go out within a week and we will have our first international speaker talking about ClojureScript at that.  This time we're back with tales from the real world, where The Brave and True have deployed Clojure in anger successfully. We have 2 speakers and promise stimulating and true stories of the successes and issues around using Clojure in high performance, high availability and mission critical software. One of the most difficult things in getting your shop or workplace to adopt a new language is being able to figure out what it does well and what it does not. It's always a bit of a chicken and egg situation as to be able to do it you have to have done it already so benefit from the experience of our two speakers Liu Dapeng and Marcus Bradstreet to help you. The talks are: \"The Clojure brain behind 40 billion requests a day, a story of deploying clojure into production\" by Liu Dapeng. Dapeng is a software developer of 10 years experience who has been using Clojure for three years. He has built and deployed a key component of his employer's, PocketMath, ad management system in clojure and this is that story with comparisons to Java, how clojure worked and didn't, the unexpected  wins and losses including time travelling and the challenges of getting a new language accepted by his management. \n\n\n\n\"Clojure Embraces Pragmatism\" by Lucas Bradstreet. Lucas is a software developer of many moons and has been working with Clojure for more than 2 years. His talk is about the how Clojure is a language for getting stuff done primarily and not proving academic or style points. His talk will demonstrate how Clojure is more than any other language a language for developers who care about shipping product. I'm finalising the location but it will be central and I'll update this metup with the details.","location":"To be announced soon but definitely nice and central., Central, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup/events/226155840/","group_id":18616301,"group_name":"Singapore Clojure Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup","formatted_time":"28 Oct 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-10-28T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-28T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"dnnbglytnblc","name":"Hackware v1.2","description":"Hackware is a monthly meetup for hardware developers and enthusiasts to share hacks and developments in the hardware scene, promote hardware development and to build a community of hardware developers.  Our talks typically include side projects by speakers on electronics, embedded system, radio communications, internet of things, radio frequency and much more!

We have come out with this special event with PayPal and invited Douglas to give a talk to the SingaporeJS community! Upgrading the Web  The web was originally imagined to be a simple distributed document retrieval system. It is now being used for applications that go far beyond the system's original capabilities and intentions. We have found ways to make it work, but they are difficult and far too fragile. Many times companies have offered to replace the web with superior proprietary systems, but we rejected them. We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying deficiencies, increasing instead of reducing its complexity. This talk suggests a way forward, taking inspiration from our successful transition from NTSC to HDTV. There is a way forward to a web that is safer, easier, and as good as we desire. Douglas Crockford is best known for his ongoing involvement in the development of the JavaScript language, for having popularized JSON, and for developing various JavaScript tools such as JSLint and JSMin. He is currently a senior JavaScript architect at PayPal, and is also a writer and speaker on JavaScript, JSON, and related web technologies.
