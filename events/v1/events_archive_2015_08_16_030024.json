Clarence Tauro from CouchBase will be traveling to Singapore on that week and will be our guest speaker. We have interviewed Clarence here. Abstract NoSQL databases offer a significant change to how enterprise applications are built, challenging to two-decade hegemony of relational databases. The question people face is whether NoSQL databases are an appropriate choice, either for new projects or to introduce to existing projects. This talk will give a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency and polyglot persistence. It will then dive into Couchbase, which is a high-performance NoSQL distributed database with a flexible data model. Finally it will discuss how to integrate CouchBase with Spring using the Spring Data Couchbase project.  ============================================Note: if you are interested to go for CouchBase training in Singapore, all information is available here:  http://training.couchbase.com/class/for-developers/cd220-developing-couchbase-nosql-applications/singapore-central-singapore/2015a","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/224470403/","group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"224445724","name":"DSSG Aug Meetup - DataRobot","description":"*Please note that RSVP will only start on Sunday (Aug 16), 1230pm.* This month, we are proud to have Xavier from DataRobot to do a deep dive into data modeling.   Synopsis: Xavier will present the solution he and his colleagues from DataRobot developed to win the 3rd prize at the KDDCup 2015. The competition consisted of predicting dropouts of students of XuetangX, a MOOC platform initiated by Tsinghua University in China.

Ikeda's work is deeply rooted in an ongoing investigation of mathematics and science. He uses stunning, immersive visuals, and a distinctive electronic music style to communicate complex topics about the outer limits of science, in a highly accessible way.  \n\nHis performance for ArtScience Late, as part of the Sound Islands Festival, is supercodex [live set]. It makes the invisible data that permeates our world tangible and perceivable.  The performance showcases how sound can be turned into data and how data can be turned into sound.  supercodex [live set] draws inspirations from the idea of quantum superposition, a key principle of contemporary physics. It investigates how we understand the reality of nature on an atomic scale through mathematical models and quantum mechanics. supercodex [live set] begins subtly, with digital noise, pure tones and bass drones, and gradually builds into an immersive, textured sensory audiovisual experience.\n\nDon’t miss this unique opportunity to see one of the world's most acclaimed experimental performers, in an extraordinary live event that is bound to be an unforgettable experience. \n\nConcept, composition: Ryoji Ikeda\nComputer graphics, programming: Tomonaga Tokuyama\nFor more information please visit: http://www.ryojiikeda.com/archive/concerts/#supercodex_live_set\n\nPart of the Soundislands Festival [Logo] \n\nAbout Ryoji Ikeda\n\nHailing from Japan, and based in France, Ryoji Ikeda focuses on the essential characteristics of sound, light and mathematics.
