For those who don't know Clojure has a sibling for the front end, ClojureScript. Using the same criteria for the design of Clojure, ClojureScript is a self contained way of using the functional programming constructs you are familiar with in Clojure in the front end presentation layers. It compiles to pure Javascript with similar benefits that Clojure gains from running on the JVM.  The theme for this Meetup is ClojureScipt and we are very lucky to have Isaac Johnston giving our first talk. Isaacs's talk is titled: Half a Year using Clojurescript and React in MiddleEarth Isaac is an experienced Javascript developer continually exploring different ways to write JavaScript. He works tirelessly defending his home of middle earth's and other far off land's communications at SMX, a global cloud security and carrier-grade email provider. Passionate about functional programming, he is currently prototyping SMX's next generation front-end stack in ClojureScript and React. He is coming to us from JConf.Asia where he has given a talk \"Simplicity Through Functions\" earlier today. Ours second speaker is Melvin Zhang whose demo is titled: Building a reactive web frontend with Hoplon  Melvin is an avid programmer who enjoys designing and implementing novelalgorithms.  As the lead architect of Cosmiqo, Melvin is in charge of developing its sensor data aggregation and analytics platform. In his sparetime, Melvin works on the AI for Magarena, an open source card game project. He also gave the first talk in this meetup. We will be taking  break in December but the January meetup will be announced before the end of the month. ","location":"Neo Innovation , 53A Craig Road , 089691, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup/events/226645775/","group_id":18616301,"group_name":"Singapore Clojure Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup","formatted_time":"19 Nov 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-11-19T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-11-19T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"226558412","name":"Meteor November Meetup","description":"Hello everyone, Doors open from 7pm and we will start the talks promptly at 7.30pm.

In Spooky, Strangeweather considers the theory of quantum entanglement, puts it on the backburner, and creates an off-kilter dance performance of impolite improvisation scores and congruent choreography. Yang intercepts the performance with a resounding set installation and what happens next is anyone’s guess. This rendition of Spooky is performed by Bernice Lee, Faye Lim and Andy Yang.
