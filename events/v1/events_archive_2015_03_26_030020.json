This time it'll be on the 26th of March at the ThoughtWorks' office. Venue: 87B Amoy Street #03/04, Singapore 069906, Singapore We're still looking for one more 10-15 minute talk, if you're interested please contact us! PyCon Singapore is going to be June 17th to 19th and the call for proposals is up on the website, if you have something to share then please sign up! https://pycon.sg/proposals/ -------------- Talks 1. \"Getting started with testing using Pytest and Mock\" by Gabe Hollombe. Pytest is a great alternative testing framework to unittest from the standard library. It often lets you get the same tests written with far fewer lines of code, and it has a cool dependency injection system to help you share common test dependencies while keeping your tests understandable. I'll tell you all about how to get basic unit testing done, and I'll show you how to use Voidspace's Mock library to test collaborations between your objects, too. Gabe is a full-stack senior engineer at Neo Innovation, with a thirst for knowledge and a passion for sharing what he's learned. He's had the pleasure of speaking on four different continents about JavaScript, Ruby, Vim, and HTML5 Game development. 2. \"Developing real time applications in Django with Websockets \" by Gerald Goh Utilising swampdragon , I'll be showing how to build a simple real time chat application in Django. Gerald is a full stack developer at Apvera Pte. Ltd., a security analytics startup. 3. \"How to learn and be productive with Python3 in a week\" by Chris Chris will talk about how you can go from knowing nothing of Python to being productive in a week. • Basic Python syntax and environment setup ( IDE, virtualenv ) • Data type • How to use libraries 4. \"Three Python tips\" by Martin Brochhaus We are hoping to repeat this talk with different speakers at the end of each meetup. Martin will make the start and give quick introductions to three basic Python tools that will make your life easier: * Virtualenv * Virtualenvwrapper * Flake8 Martin is the founder of Bitmazk Pte. Ltd., a Singapore based web development agency specialized on creating web apps with Python and Django. He is also part of the organizing committee for PyCon Singapore and an active member of Python User Group Singapore. 5. Alfred from PyCon APAC will talk about the upcoming APAC conference in Taiwan. -------------- Would you like to speak at this or a future meetups? You could share about your technology stack, how you solved a problem, your new library, or your opinions on best practices, so that people can get to know how awesome you are! 5 Python tips is a small segment at the end of meetup where you can share some things that make your Python life easier. A newly discovered core module, a library or some command line tool that makes your life better and/or easier. So don't be shy! Step forward and share your knowledge! For speaking please contact Björn, @gaqzi or <ba@sanitarium.se>, or Victor <icyisamu@gmail.com> See you all soon! -------------- Job Postings Are you looking for Pythonista?

Venue: SR3, Town Plaza, UTown Free pizza is served before the talks. --- Purely Functional Deployments with Nix: Hacking on \"Web Scale\" Applications Talk description Cloud hosting allows us to build brittle networks out of less reliable components faster than ever before. Tools like Puppet and Docker help manage this complexity, but we can do better. Instead of declaring or packaging the state of an infrastructure, what if we could manipulate it as a data structure? At ZALORA, we've built the largest known web application infrastructure described by a purely functional program. Using a combination of Nix, NixOS, and our own Upcast, we don't just deploy our networks—we check them into Git. You'll see the steps we took to get here and the concepts we've borrowed from computer science, like metaprogramming, along the way. Speaker profile Chris joined ZALORA in 2013 after leaving the web startup field in California. He learned to code by hacking together programs on his HP 48G graphing calculator in order to automate his math homework. He started writing web applications in 2001, right after the dot-com crash. You can view some of his code at https://github.com/jekor --- Functional Reactive Programming on iOS Talk description Programs take input, from various sources, transform it, and produce some output. That input could be keyboard events, GPS Signals, time triggers, web responses, or all of them at the same time. Similarly, outputs can be anything from rendering a kitten, to performing an API Request, to flushing a toilet. Functional Reactive Programming broadly models these input outputs flows as “signals”, which can be composed, and transformed to return new signals. Programs can therefore model their “inputs - transform - output” pipelines, explicitly. This has a number of advantages, the most prominent one being the escape from the inevitable callback hell, when modeling and coordinating multiple asynschronous events. Reactive Cocoa is a powerful FRP framework for Cocoa, which brings these concepts from the “ivory tower” to OSX/iOS land. This talk will take a shallow dive into the framework, showcasing FRP’s usefulness in somewhat real world scenarios. Speaker profile Omer is an NUS Hackers alumnus, currently working as an iOS Software Engineer at Garena. He also moonlights as a Haskell proselytizer, and is a little obsessed with writing useless, toy compilers. --- Our Sponsors Friday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center and the Infocomm Development Authority.

MasterCard hackathon is taking place in Singapore on March 28-29. Use the code HackAngel for free tickets. http://bit.ly/mocsg The CONCEPT How is a truly gifted Coder (as in programmers, designers and developers) distinguished today? For thousands of years, master artisans were honored with an insignia in recognition of their talent. A distinct object such as a pin or hat established their dominance in a field. “Coders”, as we define them here, have become the world’s newest artisans. Just as master builders were essential for the creation of a business 400 years ago, Coders are needed for everything from website creation to server maintenance and developing new in-house platforms. Yet there is no identifying seal showcasing the quality of Coders, their rank amongst peers or even their trials and accomplishments. Enter the MasterCard Masters of Code Competition. Through this intense series of hackathons we have one goal: to traverse the globe and engage the very best Coders. Each regional hackathon will have developers, designers and entrepreneurs using the MasterCard APIs to create masterful prototypes that demonstrate artful coding and design skills, while articulating clear business cases. The competition will be intense and the tension high, but we are looking to create a different experience for our participants. Each event will be held in one of the most thriving tech communities worldwide – and at the best venues there. Winners from each region will be flown out for the Grand Finale Masters of Code Hackathon in Silicon Valley to experience a MasterCard Priceless Experience – Northern California. The final itself will be just like the regionals with up to ten teams from the region events and one MasterCard elite team of Coders. The winning team will be recognized as the first Masters of Code Champions and given their Masters of Code Jackets, $100,000 and many other perks. Only the global winning team will be given this honor and privilege. THE COMPETITION Regional Level: Each region has a specific Challenge, Featured API and Secret API that attendees can go after. While you don't have to use all three in your hack, bonus points will be awarded to those that do. The Singapore Challenge: Using Commerce/Payments to Empower Women The Singapore Featured API: Simplify Commerce The Singapore Secret API: Shh, you'll have to wait for the event to find that out... PRIZES Grand Prize* The MasterCard Masters of Code Champions will be crowned and will receive $100,000 to develop their innovation, in addition to the following prizes*: Two weeks on-site at the MasterCard Start Path™ accelerator location in Dublin, Ireland, or an alternate remote program Six months of mentoring from a member of the MasterCard Open API executive team and the Start Path program team Free payment processing for up to $250,000 in transactions for the first 12 months using Simplify Commerce**.. *Prizes may be modified to accommodate regional availability and regulations of the winning team location **Legal Disclaimer: To qualify for this promotion, a Masters of Code team must apply to become and be approved as a Simplify Commerce merchant and actively transact via Simplify Commerce Gateway. “Actively transact means conducting a sales transaction that results in Simplify Commerce making a deposit to the checking account you have linked to your Simplify Commerce merchant account. If you qualify, Simplify Commerce will rebate the 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction processing fee for your first $250,000 in sales that occurs within 12 months after the company becomes a Simplify Commerce merchant. Should a transaction be refunded, it will not be eligible for a rebate. After the company reaches $250,000 in sales, processing fees will remain 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction (or the standard rate at that time).

This time we will be reading the book High Performance Web Sites together. Here is the description about the book: Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Format for the book club: 1. Buy the book and read the Chapter BEFORE the meetup. 2. Pick an Item from the Chapter and prepare some discussion points and/or questions. 3. Let the rest of us know which Item you picked by leaving a comment.

One talk will be by - Sergiu Bodiu , a Sr. Solution Architect on the Pivotal team, about building cloud native applications. The other talk will be by Kailash Nath one of our best Hadoop expert at Pivotal Asia, will be talking BigData. Find details about both talks below. Schedule for the evening: 6:45 - 7:15 :: Food and networking 7:15 - 8:45 :: Talks and Q&A 8:45 - 9:00 :: Mingling -------------- Talk Title: Build Cloud Native applications Speaker: Sergiu Bodiu, Sr. Solution Architect, Pivotal Abstract: There’s a certain “dark ages” between the waning days of Java and .Net and the renaissance we have now with PaaS and other microservices-think driven platforms. \"GoldPlating\" That's right, friend. Before long, you'll discover that almost any problem can be made more complicated! Tap into the unemptyable wells of PrematureComplexity & AccidentalComplexity, and have a heyday! Fortunately many of the innovators in the space, including Twitter, LinkedIn, and Netflix, have embraced the JVM as they’ve built increasingly complex systems. Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems. Spring Boot is a micro framework for micro service applications. With the advent of microservice and cloud-native application architectures, building distributed systems is becoming increasingly common for the enterprise Java developer. About: Sergiu is a seasoned consultant experienced in large-scale e-commerce projects, passionate about providing innovative technology solutions to solve complex business problems, have extensive knowledge and experience delivering enterprise wide applications. ===================== Talk Title: \"Implementing Hadoop in a large enterprise - experience sharing\" Speaker: Kailash Nath, Technical Architect, Pivotal \"Yay! I see the elephant in the room\". It took a real long time for those \"strategists\" to accept the fact that there is an elephant in the room. How many of them really see the full elephant? Business intelligence has been used by architects for assessing architecture model and correct EA strategy all along. And so pattern like distributed computing is nothing new for them. Yet, why Hadoop/big data initiative fail or don't impress while nextgen Silicon valley enterprises make software that is eating the world using these tools? Data analytics use cases are often IT teams view of business rather than business use case defined by business users. If you don't have a big data business use case sponsored by business user, stop your project right now and save money/energy of those highly paid Hadoop experts. About: Kailash is a Technical architect with 14+ years of industry experience. Prior to joining Pivotal, he has lead the big data initiative for a large airline company and has worked 3 years on some of the largest Hadoop projects. His experience includes end to end architecture and design of large scale OLTP system like B2B e-Commerce platform, large scale integrations solutions, mobile commerce platform, high volume OLAP solutions etc. ","location":"PayPal office in Millenia Tower, 1 Temasek Avenue Millenia Tower #14-01, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/220813250/","group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"09 Apr 2015, Thu, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2015-04-09T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-04-09T12:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"955696531115860","name":"ArtScience Late","description":"One Thursday a month, 7pm to 10pm Metamorphosis By Panagiotis Tomaras and Tom Shellsuit 7.45pm and 9pm Expression Gallery, Level 4 Enjoy a feast for the eyes and the ears through visual artist Panagiotis Tomaras' stunning video work complemented with sounds by DJ Tom Shellsuit.

We want to give everyone a chance to speak, and get people out at a reasonable time. Other items of note for the weekend Volunteers at all levels are welcome throughout the weekend . If you're already a pro, we're looking for some subject-area experts to help with project preparation and be resources throughout the DataDive. Unlike a hackathon, the goal is not (necessarily) to create an app, and it is not a competition. Instead, the objective is to work with teams of experts to understand a truly difficult problem through data. You could end up with a visualization, an analysis, some graphs, or even just some new datasets by the end of the event, and all of those are fantastic results! There is a Github repository setup to use for sharing code, data, and analyses during the event . This will be our primary resource for capturing everything developed at the DataDive, so please use it for sharing and collaboration. We do not assign you to a problem . We want you to work with the problem and data you feel most passionate about, so come Friday with an open mind and be ready to learn. You do not have to stay the entire weekend to participate in the event . We hope that you will find a project you can dig into, but you are always welcome to come and go as you please. You do not have to work on the same project for the whole weekend . Again, we hope that you will find a project to work on to completion, but if at any point you feel like you want to change simply let the DataKind project team lead for your team know. We do not provide any hardware or software for you to use . We'll have the data and some services set up (hackpad, Github), but otherwise you should bring your own laptop and come ready to use whatever data tools you like. See you there!
