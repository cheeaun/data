The weirdness of light","description":"  \n   \nMaxwell's wave or Einstein's LichtQuanten? The weirdness of light  \nSince the early days of quantum mechanics, interference between spatially separated trajectories of a single particle has not ceased to fascinate physicists. I will present experiments realized with a single photon, which have allowed us to emphasize the weirdness of the concept of wave particle duality, at the root of the quantum revolution of the 20th century. Such single photon sources are now an important resource in the domain of quantum information and quantum cryptography. \n  \n \nAbout the speaker \nBorn in 1947, Alain Aspect is an alumnus of ENS Cachan and Université d'Orsay. After three years teaching in Cameroon, he became a lecturer at ENS Cachan, with his research at Institut d'Optique. In 1985 he took a research position at ENS/Collège de France, with Claude Cohen-Tannoudji. Since 1992 he has been a CNRS senior researcher (emeritus since 2012), at Institut d'Optique. He is also a professor at Institut d'Optique Graduat School (Augustin Fresnel chair), and at Ecole Polytechnique, in Palaiseau. He is a member of the Académie des Sciences (France), Académie des Technologies (France), National Academy of Sciences (USA), OAW (Austria). \n  \nAlain Aspect's first research involved tests of Bell's inequalities with entangled photon pairs (PhD 1983), then wave-particle duality for single photons. With Claude Cohen-Tannoudji he developed new methods for cooling atoms with lasers. Since 1992, he is in the Atom Optics group that he has established at Institut d'Optique, where research bears upon quantum atom optics, quantum degenerate gases and atom lasers, quantum simulators of disordered materials. \n  \n   \n  \nThis event is organised by the Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore in partnership with the Science Centre Singapore.

You will see that Bayesian networks are ideally suited to model a wide range of high-dimensional problem domains. Overall, this course's focus in on leveraging Bayesian networks for applied research, with the objective of solving problems that currently appear difficult or intractable with traditional statistical methods. \nThis \"short course\" is a compact version of the highly acclaimed 3-Day Introductory BayesiaLab Course, which we have been offering around the world for almost ten years. We have designed this new 2-day course for scientists who are interested in utilizing Bayesian networks for their research, but for whom the current 3-day program might be too much of a time commitment. \nThroughout this course, we exclusively use the BayesiaLab software platform. Therefore, you have access to a full license of BayesiaLab Professional for a 30-day period starting on the first day of the course.
