Performing works from her seminal album, ‘Unflesh’, this evening promises to be highly visual with challenging visions of “horror-pop”.\n\nJoining Gazelle Twin is Singapore based Japanese artist Yuzuru Maeda, who will perform pieces from her Zentai Art Project including ‘UFO concert’, a work which asks the question ‘what if we were the only one in the universe?’. The performance will explore dynamic temperature change, climate change, disasters, and extremes in economy and political conflicts, and where the connection between technology and nature can allow us to feel less alone. Together with CIRCUITRIP + NZSDLX, the music starts in a collection of the voices, ending with the music generated by a handmade circuit-bending plastic bra.\n\nFutureEverything Singapore is a partnership between FutureEverything and Singapore's Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), one of the key government agencies championing Singapore’s efforts to become the world’s first Smart Nation. IDA is the organiser of the umbrella programme, the Festival of Tech (www.festivaloftech.sg).","location":"ArtScience Museum","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1450846311888682","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/156726297714355","formatted_time":"10 Sep 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-09-10T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-09-10T14:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"224733849","name":"Sep/2015 - Open Space (Motivation)","description":"Open Space Facilitator: Marcelo Cosas Open Space Theme: Motivation  Agenda 7:00pm - Networking and pizza 7:30pm - Topic generation 8:00pm - Breakout sessions 10:00pm - End We welcome contributions of drinks and snacks! =) What is Open Space?
