This week we'll be covering the chapters on NoSQL and ZeroMQ. At the end of each week's meetup we will take a vote to select ~two chapters from any of the three AOSA Volumes available. If there's a particular chapter you want us to cover, attend the next meetup and cast your vote!  \"If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your more experienced colleagues think, these books are the place to start. If you are an intermediate or senior developer, and want to see how your peers have solved hard design problems, these books can help you too.\" How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues!
