The consistent strategic problem faced by law enforcement agencies globally is how to achieve the best results with limited resources.  This includes maintaining public order, reducing crime, or maintaining the current status quo with reduced resources. In order to solve these issues, we must discover the actionable predictors (such as time and weather) of different types of crime, specific to each location or place type (such as a neighborhood or nightclub), in order that resources are used to best effect. This talk examines preliminary results using the UK Police Crimes and Outcomes dataset from December 2010 to June 2014, which has a relatively large volume: more than 19 million crime and anti-social behavior incidents from 43 police forces ( please see http://data.police.uk/ ). \nFinally, this talk explains how smart policing is applicable to campus security. \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n FAQs \nWhere can I contact the organiser with any questions? \nPlease feel free to email ryanlbk@tp.edu.sg if you have any questions.","location":"Temasek Polytechnic Auditorium 2 & Foyer, , 21 Tampines Avenue 1, Singapore 529757","url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/e/tp-infotechday-2015-all-about-big-data-smart-solutions-iot-seminar-registration-16012532917?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Temasek Polytechnic School of Informatics & IT and Singapore Computer Society","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/7989857219/","formatted_time":"25 Mar 2015, Wed, 1:30 pm","start_time":"2015-03-25T05:30:00Z","end_time":"2015-03-25T10:30:00Z"},{"id":"16010703445","name":"ibidi: Cells in Focus - Seminar Series @ IMB","description":"Abstract \nHow to combine cell culture and cell based assays with high end microscopy   Long-term imaging of living cells is an increasingly important technique in cell biology.

From Silicon Valley to Silicon Straits, this humble material has become synonymous with high-tech enterprise driven by the ever increasing computation power and shrinking size of CMOS processors. However, transistors cannot simply keep getting smaller (the characteristic size of CMOS transistors is now only 60 atoms wide). At these scales, the bizarre laws of quantum mechanics come into play: electrons can be in two places at once (called ‘superposition), and can ‘tunnel’ through barriers. Controlling electrons at these scales becomes a bit like herding (Schrödinger) cats, making it impossible to build basic computing components. Chip designers today have been using all their ingenuity to fend off this ‘quantum limit’ for a few more years with novel designs, but reaching the limit is inevitable. Instead of trying to work around these troublesome quantum effects, it is possible to build an entirely new type of computer whose operation fundamentally relies on quantum features such as superposition. There are a wide range of different technologies being explored to build such a ‘quantum computer’, including arrays of trapped ions addressed by lasers, and circuits of superconducting aluminium kept a few thousands of a degree above absolute zero. Recent results from laboratories around the world suggest that silicon could in fact provide a platform for such quantum processors - this include superposition states that last for 3 hours, or being able to measure individual dopant atoms in silicon nano-devices. We still have a little way to go before silicon can be considered to be on an equal footing with other quantum computing designs, but this isn’t the first time silicon has played catch-up. After all, lead sulfide and germanium were used to make transistors before high-purity silicon and CMOS technology came along. So far, we have every reason to think that silicon will survive the next big computational leap, from the classical to the quantum age. \n  \nJohn Morton studies the coherent control of electron and nuclear spins in solid state materials and devices, with a focus on quantum technologies. He is a Professor at University College London in the UK. Quantum technologies are ones which exploit quantum superposition and entanglement to achieve major advances over current technologies in areas including communication, sensing and information processing. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nThis event is organised by the Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore in partnership with the Science Centre Singapore.","location":"Science Centre Singapore, , 15 Science Centre Rd, Singapore 609081","url":"http://cqt.eventbrite.sg/?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/2560122282/","formatted_time":"25 Mar 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-03-25T11:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-03-25T12:30:00Z"},{"id":"221025182","name":"Meteor/MongoDB Mashup Meetup","description":"Hello everyone, We are group of people who think MeteorJS is awesome.
