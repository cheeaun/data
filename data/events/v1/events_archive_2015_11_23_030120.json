There will be refreshments, kindly provided by our host, IDA. Agenda 6.45pm-7.15pm: Networking session  7.15pm-7.45pm: Dat Le: Data infrastructure to support data science and visualization 7.45pm - 8.15pm: beeline.sg 8.15pm - 8.30pm: data.gov.sg 8.30pm - 9pm: Networking session. Speaker Bio Dat Le  Dat Le is currently a Senior Data Technologist at Commercialize TV. He did his Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham (2009) and Masters at the University of Oxford (2010). He built the Data Warehouse and Data Team at Zalora in 2013-2014, and currently at Commercialize TV (since 2015). He’s a data enthusiast - he loves contributing to open-source data projects in Python / Haskell / Shellscripts and participating in data science challenges in his free time. In this talk, Dat will share his experiences on building data infrastructure specifically to support BIs, Data Analysts, and especially Data Scientists in small and large scale companies. Beeline Beeline seeks to create a bridge between the cheap but lengthier public transport and faster but costly private transport. To achieve this, we bring together crowd-sourced insights and historical data analytics In this session, we will cover the following: - How crowdsourcing is combined with historical data to optimise bus route - What operational issues arise when transitioning analytics-proposed routes into real-world deployment - Whether our experimentation succeeded, or failed, in changing the commuting patterns of Singapore - How we process large amount of farecard transaction and taxi data (using a graph-based algorithm) Daniel Sim is a Data Scientist at the Infocomm Development Authority. He did his Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge (2013) and Masters at ETH Zurich (2015). In 2014, he worked on one of the algorithms underlying Beeline as an intern and is currently assisting helping Beeline get past the fledgling state. He is a strong believer in D-R-Y and believes in aggressively automating away any repetitive tasks. Data.gov.sg Data.gov.sg was launched in 2011 as the Singapore government's one-stop portal to its open data. The new data.gov.sg, now in public beta, goes beyond being a data repository. It aims to make government data relevant and understandable to the public, through the active use of charts and articles.We will discuss the key features on the new data.gov.sg, such as real-time APIs, dashboards and data blog. We will also share on our data quality guide, which will assist government agencies in converting their data from human-readable report formats into reusable, machine-readable formats. Lin Zhaowei is a consultant in IDA's Data Science Division, focusing on data-driven narratives and open data standards. He is part of a five-member team currently working on the new data.gov.sg portal. Before joining IDA, he was Interactive Graphics Editor at The Straits Times, in charge of conceptualising, designing and creating interactives and data visualisations for the newspaper's digital products.

In this talk I'll present an answer that's beginning to emerge, based on research my colleagues and I have been doing over the past few years.\n\nI'll start by summarizing some of the most surprising and counterintuitive results from cognitive science, and explain how they apply to learning. Then I'll describe the hypotheses we've been exploring in our research, and present our latest findings. I’ll end by suggesting what a possible future of education might look like.\n\nBIO:\nShaun Martin co-founded Applied Cognitive Science to develop data-driven models of decision-making based on new discoveries in cognitive science, and apply them to real-world problems. Shaun has a doctorate in mathematics from Oxford University, and previously held lecturing and research positions at MIT and at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.\n\nTIME:\n7:30pm Conversation\n8:00pm Talk + Q&A\n9:30pm Conversation\n10:00pm End","location":"HackerspaceSG","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1512266042404398","group_name":"HackerspaceSG","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/189278128103","formatted_time":"23 Nov 2015, Mon, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-11-23T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-11-23T14:00:00.000Z"}]}
