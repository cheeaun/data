It is sponsored annually by IBM and Baylor University, and is now in its 39th year. ICPC challenges the problem solving abilities and programming skills of contestants on a wide range of interesting computer science problems. NTU organizes a number of ICPC teams each year. To help train students, we also hold weekly practice contests and discussions conducted by SCE faculty and PhD students. In October to December each year, we organize trips to regional contests. Top finishers then go on to compete in the world finals in May. NTU has been highly successful at ICPC, advancing to the world finals 10 out the last 12 years. This year our AAA team will compete in the finals in Morocco. Join us this Friday to learn more about ACM ICPC at NTU. See the problems and techniques used to solve those problems, meet participants and trainers, elaborate on complicated problems and finally, those who wish can try to compete in a short ICPC-like contest. The speakers this week are A/P Rui Fan, Senior Research Scientist Kevin Jones, and PhD student Lubos Krcal. Dr. Fan joined NTU in 2010 after getting his PhD from MIT. He is interested in algorithms and theoretical solutions to practical problems.

First developed in the mid-19th century as Fort Pasir Panjang, the fortifications in today’s Labrador Park were later renamed the Labrador Battery in the 1930s as the British Army prepared for a possible Japanese invasion.
