With the establishment of mobile web and native mobile apps, your website isn't the only customer touch point anymore and it is critical to deliver the same user experience across all the channels (Mobile App/Mobile Web/Web). In order to do that you need to find a way to monitor and measure user experience across your delivery channels to allow both business and engineers to make the right decisions on where to invest time and money to improve user experience. Join us, as Andreas Grabner, Technology Strategist at Dynatrace, shares best practices from different global companies and learn: - which metrics you really need to monitor across your channels -how to make data-driven decisions based on these metrics -changing your deployment model of applications and new features to become metric driven and not just demand driven ","location":"The Penny Black,  26/27 Boat Quay, Singapore 049817.","url":"http://www.meetup.com/APM-Meetup/events/220941451/","group_name":"APM Meetup SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/APM-Meetup","formatted_time":"17 Apr 2015, Fri, 6:00 pm","start_time":"2015-04-17T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-04-17T12:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1569158963362746","name":"Friday Hacks #93 - Teleport, an Intelligent Routing Service & Functional Programming from First Principles","description":"For the final Friday Hacks of the semester, we'll be having Melvin Zhang, lead architect from Cosmiqo International, and Mathieu Feulvarch, senior product architect from MyRepublic. See you! Free pizza is served before the talks. Teleport, an Intelligent Routing Service Talk description Teleport is MyRepublic's intelligent routing service - a hassle-free, device-free and cost-free way of allowing subscribers to experience the Internet it was meant to be enjoyed: smooth and without restrictions. Find out how it was conceptualised and built, and why it remains as the Industry's most unique offering in its category. Speaker profile Mathieu Feulvarch is the Senior Product Architect with MyRepublic and the brain behind Teleport, the ISP's widely-lauded intelligent routing service. After discovering his passion for programming at the young age of 7, Mathieu has gone on to work in France, the US and now, of course, Singapore - bringing his over 20 years of experience to bear in seeking innovative solutions in the ever-changing Internet landscape. Functional Programming from First Principles Talk description We've heard a number of talks this semester on functional programming languages such as Elixir and Scala. These languages are large and complicated, which makes it difficult to understand the essence of functional programming. Church's Lambda Calculus is the oldest and simplest possible functional programming language. It has the following syntax: ::= a | b | ... | z ::= | (\\ ) | ( ) In this talk, we will explore Church's Lambda Calculus via a series of demos based on Tromp's 2012 IOCCC winning entry: http://www.ioccc.org/2012/tromp/hint.html An unobfuscated version of the above is available at https://github.com/melvinzhang/binary-lambda-calculus and will be used for the demos in this talk. Speaker profile Melvin is an avid programmer who enjoys designing and implementing novel algorithms. As the lead architect of Cosmiqo, Melvin is in charge of developing its sensor data aggregation and analytics platform. In his spare time, Melvin works on the AI for Magarena, an open source card game project. Melvin received his B. Comp (Hons) and Ph.D. degrees from NUS School of Computing.
