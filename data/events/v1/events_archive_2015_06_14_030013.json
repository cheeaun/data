The Orange Hive Community is all about creating curiosity -- learning and being pragmatic, applying design (in the broadest sense) to our businesses and lives. Join us and Debbie from IDEO for a morning of Life Design, followed by lunch with other Orange Hivers! We'll design our own education as lifelong learners, and hack our personal habits for physical and mental wellness, inspired by Debbie's experience in applying design thinking to her own life. You might like to team up with others to get accountability on your goals. Take a look at the curriculum, goals, skills, and highlights (so far) for Debbie's My Life Major! http://www.deborahritapaterson.com/my-life-major **Keep in mind that what we design will be fit uniquely to us, so if you like or dislike part of her design, ask yourself \"why\" you're feeling that way, rather than committing to her ideas or avoiding something altogether.
