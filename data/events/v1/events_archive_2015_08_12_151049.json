We will incorporate that feedback into our slides and repeat the meetup once more in August. We had many people on the waiting list and some couldn't make it last minute - this is your second chance!! Please only fill out this form if you really intend to come. We have only 40 seats available and we want to reach as many women as possible. A pros pros women: This is a PyLadies workshop and obviously it is aimed to mentor female developers in Singapore. We are in the early stages of building up this community and the demand seems to be huge, therefore, due to limited slots available, we cannot accept RSVPs from male developers, YET.","location":"PayPal office at 5 Temasek Boulevard, Level 7, Suntec Tower 5, Singapore 038985","url":"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vo-8ITAfMm-oSKoU1vnoRQVa1-ECQt-c7aMLaUhkpu8/viewform?c=0&w=1","group_name":"PyLadies SG","group_url":"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vo-8ITAfMm-oSKoU1vnoRQVa1-ECQt-c7aMLaUhkpu8/viewform?c=0&w=1","formatted_time":"12 Aug 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-12T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-12T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"224205391","name":"Data Mining With R (Workshop III)","description":"Hello everyone, the upcoming Data Mining with R workshop will be talking about clustering with iterative process.Clustering can be considered the most important unsupervised learning problem. The goal of clustering is to determine the intrinsic grouping in a set of unlabeled data. In this talk, Teck Por will be showing three clustering algorithms with iterative process: K-means clustering, EM clustering and kernel K-means clustering. After the introduction of the 3 popular clustering algorithms, he will also share his experience on fine tuning the parameters to address real problems, such as determine the number of clusters. Of course, in the end, the code walkthrough session will also give you an idea of how to apply these algorithms with R. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe presentation slides and the R code can be downloaded from https://github.com/singator/rugs/tree/master/data_mining/clustering","location":"Microsoft Auditorium (Singapore), One Marina Boulevard, Level 21 Auditorium, Singapore 018989 ","url":"http://www.meetup.com/R-User-Group-SG/events/224205391/","group_name":"R User Group - Singapore (RUGS)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/R-User-Group-SG","formatted_time":"12 Aug 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-12T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-12T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"224445574","name":"Meteor August Meetup","description":"Hello everyone, It's time for our August MeteorSG meetup!
