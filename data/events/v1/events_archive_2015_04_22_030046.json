Wolfgang Maehr - Interaction Designer @ Gumbuya Inc . Interaction designer with initial background of software engineering. Enjoys analytical and creative problem solving. Strong focus on pure and smooth solutions, aims for creating fun and responsible interaction with a positive impact on society. Interested in challenging international work that require crazy ideas to make peoples' lives better. Design and Analytics Design and analytics should have a symbiotic relationship with one discipline feeding the other. Reality can look quite different. This talk explores how so and what can be done to make it a fruitful relationship. Wolf is an Interaction Designer at Gumbuya, a Singaporean start up building a digital IKEA: a one-stop place to assemble modern web applications. He leads the design of the platform as well as its analytics system.

Date and time - Weds, 22nd Apr, 7 - 9pm Venue - Paypal @ Millenia Tower. Closest MRT is at Promenade MRT *** Please bring some form of identification to clear security and enter the building. Agenda: 7pm - Registration and Pizza time! 7.10pm - Short intro about Singapore Geek Girls 7.15pm - Anna's talk about \"The paradox of online collaboration: on open source work and why open source works\" 8.00pm - Q&A 8.15pm - Networking / Chilling 9.00pm - End of session! Introducing our speaker: Anna Filippova , co-organizer of RubySG and current PhD Candidate at the National University of Singapore. Anna will be sharing with us about \" The paradox of online collaboration: on open source work and why open source works \". Anna is a PhD Candidate at the National University of Singapore and co-organizer of the Singapore Ruby Meetup group. Everything she knows about computers and programming, she learned from Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) development. She is constantly trying to pay this forward. Her research looks at the social dynamics of FOSS systems, charting how projects work, and how they work through collaboration challenges. Armed with perspectives from communications and social psychology, Anna digs into conflicts to find out what makes and breaks working together online. She hopes to improve the experience of both FOSS projects and organisations that rely on remote work. You can find her work in peer reviewed academic publications like Computers in Human Behavior and CSCW proceedings. Anna has also appeared as a guest on Webuild.sg, and regularly speaks at barcamps and hackathons. Ask her how you can get involved in a project, about learning to code, or the many other ways you can become a part of the community.

Current developments have proved that language perfect for rigorous mathematical reasoning may also be used for high-performance computing with parsers that are faster than C or Java parsers (hPDB), DSLs that allow to implement matrix operations using GPUs (accelerate-openCL), or SIMD operations on parallel multicore CPUs (repa). Even shorter response times may be achieved by implementing functions within Field Programmable Logic Arrays. I will tell about the current state of hardware design, and CλaSH - a new attempt to use modern Haskell as a medium for programming of hardware programming. The Modular Compilation of Effects: Compilers are traditionally factorised into a number of separate phases, such as parsing, type checking, code generation, et cetera. However, there is another potential axis of factorisation that has received comparatively little attention: the treatment of separate language features, such as mutable state, exceptions, function abstraction and conditionals. In this talk, I will show how we can address the issue of constructing compilers that are modular in the computational features supported by the source language. This approach builds upon both the datatypes `a la carte technique for extensible datatypes and the monad transformer approach to modular monadic semantics in novel ways. # Speakers: Michał: https://github.com/mgajda Laurence: http://uk.linkedin.com/in/laurenceday/en Note: change of venue, since there are more than 20 Ingenious Haskellers coming.
