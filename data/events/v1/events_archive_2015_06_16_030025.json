Program : • 6.30PM : Beer & Pizzas • 7.00PM : Talks. • Intro to Cloud Foundry and Cloud Native Apps. Sergiu Bodiu, Sr. Solution Architect , Pivotal. He will talk about Cloud Native Apps and bring together concepts like microservices, anti-fragile, 12-factor, stateless applications. Most apps begin life as a monolithic app on a lightweight container or appserver. But when they achieve success, and the app + dev team needs to scale, major problems arise. • Cloud Foundry CLI. Justin WW Lee, Cloud Technical Evangelist, IBM He will share how to set up an instance on Bluemix quickly and use CF CLI to directly push your application into ‎Bluemix. Hope to see you there!

This talk will briefly look into a secure development lifecycle before explaining fuzzing and the different techniques that can be applied. The talk concludes with some findings and statistics that have been collected over the time. • Breaking BYOD on Apple iOS by Vincent The global market for BYOD and enterprise mobility is expected to almost quadruple in size over the next four years, hitting $284 billion by 2019. BYOD software is used by some of the largest organizations and governments around the work. Barclays, AT&T, Vodafone, US DHS, US Army, Australian Department of Energy. BYOD software promises security for enterprises. It solves Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Network privacy, jailbreaking devices, but does it really? Nope, it doesn’t! For the past 4 months, I’ve been researching into these advanced functionality that applications are using. The result of my research is an approach to defeating BYOD and advanced iOS security mechanisms in an easy and effective manner. This talk will demonstrate not only how I’ve done it but will also include a tool / framework which was designed for that purpose. Speaker(s) Bio: Michael is a security consultant at SEC Consult. His main interest is towards the offensive realm of information security, particularly vulnerability research and exploit development. Vincent is working as senior security consultant at Vantage Point Security. He is a sharp, cold-blooded, highly focused hacker with a passion for advanced mobile exploitation executed with kiasu perfection. Singaporean by birth, Vincent defies the local stereotype of accepting ‘cannot’ for an answer and lives in a world of only pure possibility. Randen: is a software engineer having 12 years of experience in working on both Enterprise/Proprietary and Open Source Technologies. Currently he is more involve in developing API and mobile applications. He had been interested with security and applies it to how he is developing his applications.
