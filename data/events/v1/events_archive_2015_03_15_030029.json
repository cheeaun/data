Or just how cool would it be to create your own OS for fun? Julien Lavergne Lubuntu maintainer will show us how to create your own distro based on Lubuntu. Meet us at FOSSASIA in the NUS Plug-In@Blk71 Lounge on Sunday at 10.30 (March 15). In the workshop you will learn several ways to to create a distro with different tools. We will show you how to start work from different base systems or distributions. You will learn about what choices are available for different use cases and how you can adapt your distribution for a specific country or for a specific showcase with your own applications. About Julien Lavergne Julien is a contributor in Ubuntu and Debian for 10 years. He is a Debian maintainer and an Ubuntu developer mainly working on the Lubuntu project as the main developer. https://gilir.wordpress.com | http://twitter.com/gilir Links Lubuntu: http://lubuntu.net FOSSASIA http://fossasia.org Twitter http://twitter.com/fossasia ","location":"NUS Plug-In@Blk71, Ayer Rajah Crescent, #05-16, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/FOSSASIA-Singapore-Open-Technology-Meetup/events/220271831/","group_name":"FOSSASIA Singapore Open Technology Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/FOSSASIA-Singapore-Open-Technology-Meetup","formatted_time":"15 Mar 2015, Sun, 10:30 am","start_time":"2015-03-15T02:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-03-15T04:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"221099268","name":"Functional Programming with Haskell for the OO Programmer with Calvin Cheng","description":"Haskell is an obscure language in comparison with other popular languages/frameworks like python/django, ruby/rails, javascript/nodejs etc; and is usually not considered in 'mainstream' start-up projects. I decided to take a look and found it an impressive language that I am comfortable using, for a new production app in my company. Our current app uses golang for the API backend. I would like to share my experiences (and pain :-p) learning the language and why I am happy with it as our API backend for a new app. This session is a compressed learn-and-hands-on session with code examples. Talk participants will be guided with hands-on coding so as to understand Haskell's type system (built-in types and user-defined types), type classes and the O-ever-so-complicated monads :-). About Calvin Cheng I am a polyglot programmer, designer and system administrator who is familiar with interface design from Sketch to JS/CSS, iOS app development, server deployment as well as backend software implementation with Python and golang. I love my work and I am currently enjoying my experiments with backend development using Haskell/Yesod.

The workshop is to get people together to learn how to go about building an network using only tools that you bring to the workshop. So, please bring along things like laptops, wifi access points, antennae, raspberry pis, solar panels, battery packs, radio transmitters and just about anything that you can think of. The workshop will be handson - with what you have - to build a functional Internet that is self contained. During the workshop, no access should be made to the event's wifi and also any cellular networks. It is an emergency (e7y) situation where there are no external networks and we need to create our own network amongst all of the participants. This exercise will be documented and the Internet Society Singapore Chapter will hold similar, but extended, workshops on \"Secure E7y Nomadic Toolbox\" About Harish Pillay Harish Pillay is the president of the Internet Society Singapore Chapter. He is a pioneer on the Internet having gotten on to the ARPAnet and UUCP networks in 1985. He is a ham and his callsign is 9V1HP.

It also covers the basics and gives useful hints to avoid common mistakes and adds recommendations about optimized build environments for reproducible results. Additionally there will be a live RPM packaging demonstration for a small software including the possibility for participants for a practical exercise by packaging another small software as RPM. The workshop will also include an overview of the GNOME community structure, collaboration practices, and ways to start contributing. After that, established GNOME contributors will help participants work their way through the newcomers tutorial which teaches the process and the tools for downloading the code for a GNOME module, testing the module locally, submitting a bug report, and providing a fix for a bug. https://wiki.gnome.org/Events/NewcomersWorkshop Depending on participants interest and time persists there is also the chance to learn about i18n in your code.
