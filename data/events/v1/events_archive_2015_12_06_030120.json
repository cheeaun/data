Weather permitting!  This time of year is a high risk of rain in the afternoon, please check the weather forecast on the day! \n\n\nAs always, the following rules apply: 1) Don't switch on your VTx without pre-announcing it to fliers currently in the air and waiting for their confirmation 2) Make sure you know your VTx frequency and are able to adjust it 3) During racing, if you're not currently racing do not switch on at all, until the current race is complete 4) Don't fly beyond your own abilities Read up on FPV etiquette! We're a friendly and encouraging group though, so even if you're a beginner we'll help you to get started.
