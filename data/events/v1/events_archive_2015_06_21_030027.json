This two-part workshop will start off with the first 2 hours learning the basic theories of data processing and management. Participant would then be able to implement what they have learnt in the second half of the workshop. Participants are encouraged to have basic programming and statistics knowledge and to bring their own laptops to make the workshop a meaningful experience. \n  \n \n  \nThis workshop, together with 4 other workshops including Guide to Android Apps Programming, Guide to iOS Apps Programming 1, Guide to iOS Apps Programming 2, and Learn to write a WordPress/Rezkii plugin with web services are pre-workshops that lead up to the actual *hackathon day.  \n  \n*Participants' for this workshop are not required to attend the hackathon, but if you want to, here's where you sign up: Mosque Tech Challenge  \n  \nOn the day of the workshop, do look out for signages to \"The Hive\" to find the classroom.  \nContacts: 9760 9715 (Sabri) / 9171 0955 (Hakim) ","location":"Blk K, Level 4 Room K407, , ITE College Central, 2 Ang Mo Kio Drive, Singapore 567720","url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/e/working-with-data-tickets-17250059392?aff=ebapi","group_name":"MTC2015","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/8218523758/","formatted_time":"21 Jun 2015, Sun, 9:00 am","start_time":"2015-06-21T01:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-06-21T06:00:00Z"},{"id":"17249454583","name":"Arduino Workshop","description":"Until recently you needed a strong technical education to use a microcontroller to build amazing gizmos and gadgets. \nAll this changed with the arrival of the Arduino, a cool, easy to use, community driven microcontroller board with tons of software, tutorials, code samples and videos online all for free. \nCoupled with the inexpensive hardware this means that many can venture boldly into trying new ideas with a far lower chance of blowing things up and a far higher chance of success in a realistic timeframe. \nIn this class you will learn how to control things like LED, servo motors and LCD panels as well as detecting things like changes in light levels and reading codes entered on a keypad, but the biggest thing that you will learn is the confidence to venture on your own to build amazing things that you never even thought about before. \nRequirements  HackerspaceSG and 12Geeks will be lending the Arduino Kits for the workshop, so all you need to bring is a notebook computer - Mac / Windows / Linux are all compatible. \n  \n  \n  \nThis workshop, together with 4 other workshops including Guide to iOS Apps Programming 1, Guide to iOS Apps Programming 2, Working With Data and Learn to write a WordPress/Rezkii plugin with web services are pre-workshops that lead up to the actual *hackathon day.  \n  \n*Participants' for this workshop are not required to attend the hackathon, but if you want to, here's where you sign up: Mosque Tech Challenge \n  \nOn the day of the workshop, do look out for signages to \"The Hive\" to find the classroom.  \nContacts: 9760 9715 (Sabri) / 9171 0955 (Hakim) ","location":"The Hive, Blk K, Level 4 Room K407, , ITE College Central, 2 Ang Mo Kio Drive, Singapore 567720","url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/e/arduino-workshop-tickets-17249454583?aff=ebapi","group_name":"MTC2015","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/8218523758/","formatted_time":"21 Jun 2015, Sun, 2:00 pm","start_time":"2015-06-21T06:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-06-21T10:00:00Z"}]}
