DevOpsDays follow a quite unique format and in this meetup we'd like to introduce you the core concepts of DevOpsDays. DevOpsDays work best when you step out of your comfort zone and contribute by asking questions, suggesting ideas for open spaces, talk etc. It's what *you* make out of it and we want to provide you the best environment for sharing, open discussions and having fun with like-minded people from all over the world. A lot of attendees report that their first DevOpsDays has been a career-changing experience (examples: https://www.google.com/search?q=devopsdays+review ). We aim high and believe that we can make this the best DevOps event in Asia. For that we would love to hear your feedback, questions and ideas upfront. *Sounds good… I have a question!* Just add a comment below to ask us all the questions. *Agenda* 18:45 Start – grab some great food from the buffet and enjoy a drink with others 19:15 *Talk: What is DevOpsDays & How is it special?* 19:35 Break 19:50 *Talk: Help you prepare a talk and OpenSpace for DevOpsDays* 20:05 Break 20:15 *Talk / Fishbowl: DevOpsDays FAQ* 21:00 End Food and drinks will be served.

Real-time applications mimic what we have in the real world, information as it happens being pushed to us. In this presentation you will learn how to build a more interactive and engaging user experience with Server-Sent Events and WebSockets. We will review the Spring Websocket architecture, the STOMP support, how to secure a WebSocket application and the new Spring 4.2 features. Speaker: Xavier Lepretre Title : Introduction to RxJava, with code examples Description : Functional Reactive Programming, and in particular its Java implementation, is well suited to applications that rely a lot on asynchronous calls and thread hopping. Discover the major coding elements of RxJava that will get you started. Non-developers may have their eyes glaze over by the 7th slide, though. Bio: Xavier has been coding on and off from the days of BASIC and Pascal, has used RxJava with Android at TradeHero for the past 7 months and did not look back.
