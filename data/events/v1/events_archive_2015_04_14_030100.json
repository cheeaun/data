This time we will be reading the book High Performance Web Sites together and creating interactive exercises to go along with it. Join the SingaporeJS Chat Bookclub for the 14th of April: Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5. Michael skipped ahead and gave us a great overview of Chapters 3 and 4 at the previous meetup, so let's make sure everyone has read them plus Chapter 5. Here is the description about the book: Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Format for the book club: 1. Buy the book and read the Chapter (s) BEFORE the meetup. 2. Pick an Item from the Chapter and prepare some discussion points and/or questions. 3. Let the rest of us know which Item you picked by leaving a comment. We will be reading at Tim & Wei's residence at Tanjong Katong Road. Door opens at 6.30pm. Feel free to ask questions in the SingaporeJS Chat Room See you there!
