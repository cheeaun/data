DATE HAS CHANGED !!!!!! We will have two speakers for this Wednesday's meet-up! Kushal hails from Pune, India, and Shubham from Singapore (sort-of already lah! :-)) ---- Topic 1: Discovering distributed task queue in its simplest form using Retask Synopsis: The primary objective of this talk is to present Retask as a distributed Task/Job queues system. Retask uses Redis in the backend and keeps the data in JSON format. After the talk people will have the knowledge required to start using Retask in their own projects as distributed queue. The talk will demonstrate: Using queues can be easy! API (5 tiny methods, I promise). Asynchronous & synchronous communication between workers and producers. Real life use cases in Fedora Infrastructure and inside Red Hat. Speaker: Kushal Das is a core developer of CPython. He is a Fedora Ambassador and also director at Python Software Foundation. He is currently working as Fedora Cloud Engineer at Red Hat. Topic 2: Hands-on session: Using RNN to build classifiers and applications to reviews or sentiment analysis Synopsis: Soon... Speaker: Shubham Goyal Shubham is a nerd working at the Sensor Enhanced Social Media (SeSaMe) Center at NUS. He is happy to spend his time learning new things and sharing what he has learnt. Feel free to reach out to him at shubhamjigoyal@gmail.com if you want to say hi or waste time talking about most topics under the sun.

NicoNicoGakkai Beta is a new style of academy that emphasizes user-generated research. It is an online and offline research academy that recognizes research on a diversity of merits, from cultural and artistic values to academic and industrial strengths. (http://blog.stepup.io/post/71963779785/nico-nico-gakkai-the-craziest-japanese-science) Rapid Fire Research 100 “Rapid Fire Research 100” was one of the two formats unique to this conference. In just 15 minutes, five world class researchers made 20 pitches each about their presentation. As a result, each speaker had to go though their 20~30 years worth of research in a very short time. To the audience, it was a comprehensive guide to each field as well as a motivating talk about how (initially) humble and error-prone research turns into world changing results. --In Japanese------------------------- ニコニコ学会βの人気企画、「研究100連発」を、 塚田 浩二 野嶋 琢也 寺田 努 稲見 昌彦 Jun Rekimoto 各先生方、および Maker Faire Singaporeの協力を得て、シンガポールサイエンスセンター・オーディトリウムにて、開館を特別に延長して行います！ 会場のサイエンスセンターはJulong East駅、AH2015が行われるマリーナ・ベイ・サンズから電車で40分ほどのところです。17:30-のAH2015終了後に会場に来ても間に合います！ もちろん入場無料です。ぜひご参加ください。 (プレゼンは英語ですが、動画も多いので誰が見てもわかると思います) Thanks Suranga Nanayakkara, Kiruthika Curic , Chan Sue Li and Maker Faire Singapore!","location":"Science Centre Singapore","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1476482112572441","group_name":"Singapore Mini Maker Faire","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/249266665168900","formatted_time":"11 Mar 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-03-11T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-03-11T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"1614045608827167","name":"Hackware v0.5","description":" Talks : 1.
