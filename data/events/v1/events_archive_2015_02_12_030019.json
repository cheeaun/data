A Performa commission 7.30pm & 8.45pm Expression Gallery, Level 4 Inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's mechanical noisemakers, Futurist painter and composer Luigi Russolo (1885–1947) developed an orchestra of hand-cranked instruments which he called Intonarumori. These first mechanical synthesizers produced by Russolo generated sounds of whirrs and buzzes, clangs, scrapes, sirens and mechanically plucked strings. In collaboration with the Italian Cultural Institute and Performa, ArtScience Museum presents two full performances by The Orchestra of Futurist Noise Intoners, an ensemble founded in 2009 by the Italian composer and conductor Luciano Chessa that performs on his replicas of Russolo's earliest Intonarumori orchestra. Each performance will be accompanied by a short talk by Chessa. The concert features musicians from YSTCM and LASALLE College of the Arts. Entry is complimentary and on a first come first served basis.
