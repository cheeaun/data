The Singapore edition will be a full-day event where people learn to make NodeBots and program them using Node.js. NodeBots Day is not a hackathon. There will be no prizes other than the satisfaction of making something awesome! There will be very little in the way of talks. We're going to get together, collaborate and hack. The focus of NodeBots Day is on sharing and enjoying each other's company. And JavaScript. Lots of JavaScript. https://github.com/nodebots/nodebotsday Components * Ardiuno Nano * Small Breadboard * CR Servo motors (360 Degrees rotation) (DSC04-NFC) * Ultrasonic Sensor * AA 4 Batteries and Battery Holder * Mini USB Cable * Micro Switch (Bumper) * Cable ties * M-F Jumper wires * M-M Jumper Wires ","location":"IDA Labs Level 2 @ National Design Centre, 111 Middle Road, #02-04, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/NodeBotsSingapore/events/223655016/","group_name":"NodeBots Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/NodeBotsSingapore","formatted_time":"25 Jul 2015, Sat, 10:00 am","start_time":"2015-07-25T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-07-25T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"223865763","name":"Crunch Time: Google Fusion Tables 101 + other cool visualisation tools","description":"Yitch is back to host another insightful FREE workshop for Hacks/Hackers.
