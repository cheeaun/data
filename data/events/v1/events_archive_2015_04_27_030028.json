Matt Brandwein, Director of Product Marketing at Cloudera will be speaking on Pervasive Analytics: Building a Data Strategy • How is data driving change? • Where are the opportunities, across industries? • What is required to gain value from data? • How can you get started today? Akmal B. Chaudhri will be speaking on \"Cutting through the NoSQL database hoopla and hype\" Today, there are thought to be over 150 commercial and open source NoSQL database products. Often, these products are divided into four broad categories: key-value stores, column stores, document stores and graph stores. Increasingly, some products are combining several of these categories together into what are called multi-model database systems. Whilst the market for NoSQL database systems today is still very small and thought to be around 2% of the SQL market, the technology has attracted interest from organizations looking to solve new business problems. However, since it is still an emerging technology, careful consideration is required in finding the relevant developer skills and choosing the right product. This presentation will discuss these issues in greater detail. In particular, it will focus on some of the leading NoSQL database products and discuss their architectures and suitability for different problems. Akmal's Bio: Akmal B.
