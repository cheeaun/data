There are absolutely no fees. Just come with an open mind and willingness to share and learn Agenda:  Introduction &amp; Networking : 15 mins News Bytes : 15 mins Attacks and Defenses on SOHO routers (45 mins) by Lyon Yang.  Abstract of the talk(s): 1. News BytesIt will cover the latest news on information security that were in headlines in last month. 2. Attacks and Defenses on SOHO routers In this talk we will look into how a series of 0-day vulnerabilities can be used to hack into tens of thousands of SOHO Routers. We will elaborate on the techniques that were used in this research to locate exploitable routers, discover 0day vulnerabilities and successfully exploit them on both the MIPS and ARM platforms.  Speaker(s) Bio: Lyon Yang is a senior security consultant at Vantage Point Security with a research focus on embedded systems hacking and exploitation. He is from sunny Singapore, the world’s first smart city. His regular discoveries of zero days in a variety of router models has earned him a reputation as the go-to guy for router hacking in Singapore, where he has been hired to do firmware source code reviews on popular router models. He is currently working on a comprehensive testing framework for ARM and MIPS based routers as well as shell code generation and post-exploitation techniques.
