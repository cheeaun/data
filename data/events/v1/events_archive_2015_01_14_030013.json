More specifically, the ability to perform true quantitation of proteins in a highly reproducible and timely manner is crucial to successful characterization.  \nProteinSimple aims to make western blotting as simple as possible. Here we present Wes™ , a unique, automated size-based separation and nano-immunoassay platform. It detects and characterizes protein molecular weights in denatured protein lysates at low picogram levels, automatically performs all the manual steps typically associated with traditional Western analysis techniques and provides true quantitation of results upon completion of an experiment \nJoin us for the seminar on 14th Jan and find out how to identify and quantify your protein lysate/samples in just 3 hours! \nWho Should Attend \nResearchers who are losing lots of precious time to western blots   Researchers who need reproducible quantitative protein data \nDetails \n14 Jan 2015 (Wed), 10am - 11am  Singapore General Hospital, Academia Level 4, AC4-3  \nRefreshments will be served. \nSpeaker \nFugang Deng  Field Application Scientist, Protein Simple \n  Enquire \nLeonard Lim  Email: leonard@sciencewerke.com  Contact No: +65 6777 1045 / +65 9018 3679","location":"Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore 169608","url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/e/seminar-westm-simple-your-western-14-jan-2015-tickets-15153091304?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Sciencewerke","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/428962867/","formatted_time":"14 Jan 2015, Wed, 10:00 am","start_time":"2015-01-14T02:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-01-14T03:00:00Z"},{"id":"15220352484","name":"Mommies Workshop","description":"Why Did You Choose to Quit Your Job and be a SAHM? \n What You Enjoy Being A SAHM? \n What You Don’t Enjoy Being A SAHM? \nYour role as a Stay At Home Mum has shaped you to be what you are today.

In January, Michał J Gajda, the author of hPDB ( http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hPDB ) is going to share his exciting new work: json-autotype to help Haskeller write Web Application API. Here is his description for the content of the talk. ====== There are huge APIs written entirely in JSON, and thus untyped, and unsafe to call. The traditional way to deal with this problem in strongly typed languages like Haskell, is not to examine untyped `Value` type provided by the parser, but rather write conversion functions for intended API types, and thus ensure type checking on a boundary between Web application and Haskell code. I propose to use an automatic tool json-autotype, to generate datatype declarations with Aeson's FromJSON instances from a set of example .json files. That greatly speeds up the process, and allows for very quick and well checked interfacing relatively large APIs. I will also explain the theory behind this tool. Package is available on Hackage and GitHub: https://github.com/mgajda/json-autotype . ====== About the Venue: http://www.theoffice.com.sg/where.php ","location":"The Office, 75A Pagoda Street Singapore 059234","url":"http://www.meetup.com/HASKELL-SG/events/218852617/","group_name":"HASKELL.SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/HASKELL-SG","formatted_time":"14 Jan 2015, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-01-14T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-14T13:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"1534857433430267","name":"Hackware v0.3","description":" 1.
