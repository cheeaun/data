This time we  will be discussing how we going to apply Virtual Reality technology to Advertising and Virtual Retail. Imagine the possibility of setting up storefront just like how we create websites like html now. So as, hire a virtual shopkeeper for your virtual storefront. Imagine the possibility to curate a virtual building of all the rooms, just like orchard road. Each room is a virtual shop in the building. Imagine the possibility to bring your possible customer to place or experience that you want them to experience to advertise your product. Such as taking your customer to taste a glimpse of Japan before showing them the Japan tour package. The $22tn retail industry is for us, the Virtual Reality Enthusiast to explore and set pace. Being able to simulate the real shopping experience whilst in the comfort of their own home is another big step from the present online shopping experiences.  And for marketers looking to VR / AR as a way of delivering richer brand experiences, we’ll look at examples from Nissan, Castrol, Marriott Hotels, Dior and Patron.
