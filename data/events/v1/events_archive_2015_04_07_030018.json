This time we will be reading the book High Performance Web Sites together. Here is the description about the book: Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Format for the book club: 1. Buy the book and read the Chapter BEFORE the meetup. 2. Pick an Item from the Chapter and prepare some discussion points and/or questions. 3. Let the rest of us know which Item you picked by leaving a comment. We will be reading at Tim & Wei's residence at Tanjong Katong Road. Door opens at 6.30pm. See you there!

Computational perspective","description":"Synopsis  \nAre we really alone? How many times you consider this question? And how many times you consider that we are actually ALONE? If we are not ALONE than where are they? Where are their mobile phones, internet and computers? An important part of understanding the likelihood of other life in the Universe is to establish the similarity, or otherwise, of our astronomical environment, which we know to support life, with that of the rest of the Universe. Although our current knowledge suffers from various selection effects, it is nevertheless possible to examine the similarity of our local and extended neighbourhood to that of the rest of the Universe.","location":"TMC Academy, Lecturer Theatre, , 250 Middle Rd, Singapore 188983","url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/e/public-lecture-are-we-really-alone-computational-perspective-tickets-16214546144?aff=ebapi","group_name":"TMC Academy","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/7888490585/","formatted_time":"07 Apr 2015, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-04-07T11:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-04-07T12:30:00Z"},{"id":"221096197","name":"AWS First Tuesday - April Meet up","description":"After an 11 month hiatus, the 'Amazon Web Services User Group Singapore' (AWSUGSG) is back - with a meeting on the first Tuesday in April.
