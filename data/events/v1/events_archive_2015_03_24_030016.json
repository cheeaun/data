Agenda: Event starts at 7.15 pm. - Welcome by Ewa Szymanksa, heading RIT Singapore - RIT global overview by Masaya Mori, the founder of RIT - Case study by Youngjoo: Information retrieval – Finding food entity relationships using user-generated data in a Recipe Sharing Service Abstract: Rakuten recipe is a Japanese recipe site where users submit and share their recipes with other users. Since the contents are user-generated, the recipes often contain misspellings, abbreviations, synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. Identifying and normalizing these words is essential to retrieving relevant recipes according to user's search request. In this talk, Youngjoo will introduce a new approach to finding related words in a recipe domain using the data structure. Speakers’ bios: Youngjoo Chung is a lead scientist in RIT Tokyo. She joined RIT after receiving her Ph.D in Information science and Technology from University of Tokyo in 2011. Her research interests include information retrieval, data mining, outlier detection, and recommender systems. Masaya Mori is the founder of Rakuten Institute of Technology, and is responsible for developing and managing R&D activities and IT strategies within the Rakuten Group. Before joining Rakuten, Mori-san spent eight years at Accenture, where he played a lead role in IT visioning and strategy planning, while consulting for major companies in the products and public services industries in Japan.
