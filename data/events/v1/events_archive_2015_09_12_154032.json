The location is pretty decent for many of these things. Walking out of the MRT station you'll find us under a tree near the sea. We welcome all ranges of abilities - if you need help getting your drone set up, or learning how to fly, let us know and we can help. If you can find us then call me on 9100-1743. Safety Rules:1. Don't power on your drone without checking with other fliers who may already be in the air.2. Don't fly close to people3. Make sure your drone is airworthy4. If you have any questions or are not sure, please ASK! NB - This is a casual meetup and all attendees are responsible for their own safety and liability.","location":"Marina South Pier, 31 Marina Coastal Drive , Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/dronesg/events/224965136/","group_name":"Singapore Drone Fun Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/dronesg","formatted_time":"12 Sep 2015, Sat, 3:30 pm","start_time":"2015-09-12T07:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-09-12T09:30:00.000Z"}]}
