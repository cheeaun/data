Panel Beyond skin deep: Don't be fooled by numbers! Colin Ang , Managing Director, Decision Science Agency Numbers can be very confusing. Even for analysts, without understanding some concepts of statistics, we can be easily tricked by numbers. Use these tips to analyse numbers beyond the surface appearance and unlock insights. Collin Ang is the Managing Director of Decision Science Agency, a company focused on helping clients with analytics, customer experience and digital strategy. Collin has a masters degree in statistics and has led analytics teams on both brand side and vendor side. For those particularly keen on analytics this one is for you. Digital Marketing Panel Discussion Topic: The art and science of digital marketing, get your A game on! This month we've changed up the format a little. Each month we get loads of questions on the night, often we can't answer them all. So this month we've decided to take the chains off and let the conversation flow! The second talk on the night will be a panel discussion with 3 digital marketing panelists. This should be a cracker and we strongly encourage all audience members to get involved. On the night we will provide the ability for everyone to ask questions so please come prepared! Speakers: 1. Collin Ang - Managing Director, Decision Science Agency 2. Chris Brinkworth - Regional Director APAC - Ensighten 3. Belle Chua - Analytics Manager - Starhub See you there, DAWS!
