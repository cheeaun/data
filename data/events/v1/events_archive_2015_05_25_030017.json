And, our whole team is involved in making sure you start with a blast and make awesome stuff happen! Please read the FAQ on our continually broken/changing site and GET IN TOUCH if you or someone you know might be interested. \n  \n--------> \n  \nDrinks on us. That's right: free beer/(possibly wine)/water. \n  \nHackerNest Tech Socials are a fun, relaxed way to connect with your local tech brethren. Atmosphere: chill, friendly, unpretentious, agenda-free (no sales pitch, yo), and brimming with UltraSmart(TM) people. \n  \nWe believe that strong, supportive tech communities should exist everywhere - not just in hotspots like San Francisco and New York. In 2011, we started running Tech Socials in Toronto, where our monthly attendance grew to over 350+ technologists literally 100% from word-of-mouth. \n  \nThe typical Tech Social schedule: \n  \n- 6:30pm: folks arrive, grab drinks, socialize   - 7:00pm: quick intro, thank sponsors, quick announcements   - 7:10pm: back to chatting with interesting new friends   - 9:00pm: go home exhausted from great conversations \n  \nSponsors make this growing movement possible - email us to chat! \n  \nVenue & Drinks: \n  \nViki - the first and fastest platform for real-time subtitling and sharing of video -- from Korean and Turkish dramas to Japanese Anime and music videos by well-known artists. Community members subtitle their favorite videos into their preferred languages under a Creative Commons license using Viki's subtitling technology, which enables thousands of fans around the world to collaborate in dozens of languages at once. \n  \n  \n  \n-------- \n  \nWanna show off your office? We're always looking for big open spaces with 50+ (standing room) capacity that are easily accessible. \n  \nAbout Us: \n  \nHackerNest is an international nonprofit uniting local tech communities through unpretentious Tech Socials and hackathons. We cram lots of smart, accomplished people into a room with free drinks. Our relaxed, down-to-earth events attract a diverse and highly technical membership. Strict no-douchebag policy.
