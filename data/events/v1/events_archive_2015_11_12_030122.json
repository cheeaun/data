Defeat is definitely due for him, who has neglected to take the necessary precautions - bad luck we call it.\" - Roald Amundsen\n\nScience Centre Singapore, in partnership with The Royal Norwegian Embassy, is pleased to present a special lecture and exhibition tour, titled “Polar Explorers”, by Mr. Geir Kløver.  Geir is director of the Fram Museum in Oslo, Norway, and has edited 15 books on Norwegian polar expeditions, including the personal diaries of the crew members on Roald Amundsen´s expedition to the South Pole 1910-12 and the diaries of Fridtjof Nansen.\n\nMr Geir Kløver will be speaking on the precautions that need to be taken for a successful polar expedition, stories about famous polar expeditions undertaken in the past, and  the science, navigation and survival techniques that these Polar Explorers used to overcome the harsh Arctic conditions.\n\nThis event is held in conjunction with the launch of a new temporary exhibition: Explore the Arctic – Past, Present and  Future, at the Science Centre.  Curated by Geir and his team at the Fram Museum, the exhibition covers a wide range of Arctic related topics such as people, animal and marine life, resources, climate change, and pollution. It also tells the story about the two well-known Norwegian polar explorers, Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen, and their contribution to polar research and expeditions to the Arctic. And last, but not least, the exhibition also explains why the Arctic is relevant for Singapore today. \n\nPlease kindly rsvp your interest to Jenny Leong at: jenny_leong@science.edu.sg.\n\nThe lecture and tour are free (Science Centre admission charges may apply).","location":"Science Centre Singapore","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/925207587554887","group_name":"Maker Faire Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/249266665168900","formatted_time":"12 Nov 2015, Thu, 11:00 am","start_time":"2015-11-12T03:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-11-12T04:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"404212229785162","name":"Grumpy Gits - Git Learning DevFest Asia 2015","description":"Advancing git literacy through talks and workshops.
