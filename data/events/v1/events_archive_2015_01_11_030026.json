In January, Michał J Gajda, the author of hPDB ( http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hPDB ) is going to share his exciting new work: json-autotype to help Haskeller write Web Application API. Here is his description for the content of the talk. ====== There are huge APIs written entirely in JSON, and thus untyped, and unsafe to call. The traditional way to deal with this problem in strongly typed languages like Haskell, is not to examine untyped `Value` type provided by the parser, but rather write conversion functions for intended API types, and thus ensure type checking on a boundary between Web application and Haskell code. I propose to use an automatic tool json-autotype, to generate datatype declarations with Aeson's FromJSON instances from a set of example .json files. That greatly speeds up the process, and allows for very quick and well checked interfacing relatively large APIs. I will also explain the theory behind this tool.

It will be shown in this lecture how it is possible in this way to polarize atoms, to cool them to very low temperatures, in the microkelvin, and even in the nanokelvin range. A review will be given of recent developments in this field, including ultra-precise atomic clocks, with errors less than one second in one billion years, the realization of new states of matter such as Bose-Einstein condensates, matter waves and atom lasers. New perspectives opened by these results will be briefly discussed. It is also possible to manipulate photons with atoms. By sending atoms in a cavity containing photons, one can prepare mesoscopic linear superpositions of photon states and study how they are destroyed by the decoherence processes resulting from the coupling with the environment. By analysing the state of the atoms when they exit from the cavity, one can also detect the presence of a photon in the cavity without destroying it. \nWhat can we do with a quantum liquid? \nTony Leggett (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, United States, Nobel Prize in Physics 2003) \nQuantum liquids are physical systems which display the effects not only of quantum mechanics but also those of quantum statistics, that is of the characteristic indistinguishability of elementary particles.The most spectacular manifestations of quantum statistics are the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation and the closely related one of Cooper pairing; in both cases a finite fraction of all the particles in the system are forced to all do exactly the same thing at the same time, and as a result effects which would normally be obscured by thermal noise may become visible, sometimes spectacularly so. I will review some examples of such behavior in degenerate alkali gases, superconductors and superfluid helium-3. \nQuantum property testing \nRonald de Wolf (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, the Netherlands)  \n\"Property testers\" are algorithms that can efficiently handle very large amounts of data : given a large object that either has a certain property or is somehow “far” from having that property, a tester should efficiently distinguish between these two cases. In this talk we describe recent results obtained for quantum property testing. This area naturally falls into three parts. First, we may consider quantum testers for properties of classical objects. We survey the main examples known where quantum testers can be much more efficient than classical testers. We also describe one new result : a quantum algorithm for testing whether a given n-bit Boolean function f is a k-junta (i.e., depends on only k of the n input bits) using roughly sqrtk queries to f, which is quadratically faster than the best classical testers. Second, we may consider classical testers of quantum objects. This is the situation that arises for instance when one is trying to determine if untrusted quantum states or operations are what they are supposed to be, based only on classical input-output behavior. Finally, we may also consider quantum testers for properties of quantum objects, such as whether two states or unitaries are equal, whether a state is separable, etc. This is based on joint work with Ashley Montanaro (survey arXiv:1310.2035) and with Andris Ambainis, Aleksanders Belovs, and Oded Regev (k-junta testing). \nWater pearls  \nDavid Quéré (PHHM and Ecole polytechnique, France)  \nWe show how special materials found in Nature shape water in quasi-spherical pearls. We focus on the functions generated by these materials, such as water (and even oil) repellency, self-cleaning effect, anti-fogging abilities or super-aerophilicity. We also emphasize the very unusual dynamical behaviors of liquids generated in such situations, and discuss in particular the nature of the residual friction associated with these non-wetting states.","location":"University Hall Auditorium, Level 2, Lee Kong Chian Wing, 21 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119077","url":"http://www.eventbrite.sg/e/from-quantum-physics-to-water-pearls-tickets-15153321994?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/2560122282/","formatted_time":"19 Jan 2015, Mon, 1:30 pm","start_time":"2015-01-19T05:30:00Z","end_time":"2015-01-19T10:30:00Z"},{"id":"671228176329106","name":"Front End TL;DR January 2015","description":" Double whammy to usher in the new year!

In 1994, Professor Schmidt and Professor Nicholas Suntzeff formed the HighZ SN search team, a group of 20 astronomers on five continents who used distant exploding stars to trace the expansion of the Universe back in time. The group’s discovery of an accelerating Universe was a startling one suggesting that an unknown force is countering the effect of gravity and pushing the Universe apart.  \nProfessor Schmidt continues his work using exploding stars to study the Universe, and is leading Australian National University’s Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics’ effort to build the SkyMapper telescope. \nJointly hosted by NUS and Yale-NUS College, this public lecture is part of the International Peace Foundation’s “Bridges – Dialogues Towards a Culture of Peace” speaker series at NUS. \n\n  \n“Science: Humanity’s Universal Bridge”  \nScience is one of the few arenas where humanity has worked together through history for our collective good. In his speech, Professor Schmidt will discuss the role of science through the ages in shaping our current society, reflecting on the good and the bad its knowledge has brought. While science's impact in our daily lives is higher now than ever before, to cope with future challenges the world will need further improve how it works together. It is through continual advances in our knowledge that we can hope to have the billions of the world's inhabitants live in peace and prosperity into the future.","location":"Shaw Foundation Alumni House Auditorium, Level 2, 11 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119244","url":"http://nusbridges.eventbrite.sg/?aff=ebapi","group_name":"National University of Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/7684522735/","formatted_time":"21 Jan 2015, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-01-21T11:30:00Z","end_time":"2015-01-21T13:30:00Z"},{"id":"219634734","name":"Introducing Application Security in Your Organization - Think Like a Developer","description":" In this session, the speaker, Sandeep Nain, from HP Australia and a former co-lead from OWASP Melbourne Chapter, will cover the following topics: 1.
