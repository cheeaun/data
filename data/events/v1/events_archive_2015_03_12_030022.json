Simply by using Vineger, Hydrogen Peroxide and Salt you are able to make fairly complex PCB boards. The process is simple and fast and gives you the flexibility to make 1 single board or multiple different prototype boards for testing. This workshop will introduce participants to the process of making PCB boards using a laser printer, transfer media paper and a heat press machine. Participants will get to make and assemble a working PCB board containing a 7805 regulator circuit that will take in 7-12V and output 5V. All materials are provided.

This session will start at 6.00pm. ========================= Speakers Bio ========================= Mark Plunkett Design Director of Dexel and Generic Print Shirley Tan Training Director of ACE Training ========================= Meeting Topics ========================= Session 1 Copying objects is one of those tasks InDesign users do all the time. However, I regularly come across users who aren't aware that there are many ways to copy beyond the standard copy and paste command. Join me in this session and be amazed at the many more powerful ways that InDesign can help you duplicate stuff. Session 2 Ever wondered about editorial layouts and how we can fit copy into allocated text boxes or what are copy editing terms such as Rags, Widows and Orphans. Good typography requires a good sense of understanding about creating a copy layout with simple and easy to read columns. Some may be easily solved with InDesign, while others requires manual editing. Come and join us in this meeting to learn more about the art of copy. ========================= Agenda ========================= 6.00pm - 6.30pm Session 1 with Shirley Tan 6.30pm - 6.40pm Short break & Refreshments 6.40pm - 7.10pm Session 2 with Mark Plunkett 7.10pm - 7.30pm FAQ session ========================= Refreshments ========================= Hot beverages, water and snacks will be provided during the meeting with compliments from Fuji Xerox Singapore. ========================= Facebook ========================= http://www.facebook.com/groups/idugsg/ ========================= Twitter ========================= @InDesignSG ========================= Sponsors ========================= This meeting has been made possible with the generous support of Adobe and Fuji Xerox Singapore.","location":"Fuji Xerox Singapore Level 4","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/777122369004384","group_name":"Adobe InDesign Singapore User Group","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/116531348396769","formatted_time":"12 Mar 2015, Thu, 6:00 pm","start_time":"2015-03-12T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-03-12T11:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"220930385","name":"PUGS March 2015 Meetup","description":" FOSSASIA is round the corner and Singapore will be visited by a lot of open source enthussiasts.
