I decided to take a look and found it an impressive language that I am comfortable using, for a new production app in my company. Our current app uses golang for the API backend. I would like to share my experiences (and pain :-p) learning the language and why I am happy with it as our API backend for a new app.","location":"Plug-In@Blk71","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/764781166924267","group_name":"Hackers and Painters","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/326203847521210","formatted_time":"13 Feb 2015, Fri, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2015-02-13T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-02-13T05:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"432993446849058","name":"TGIFHacks#29 - Scalability @ Viki","description":" Hey Guys, This week a team from Viki would be joining us once again, this time to talk about how Viki scales its backend API to serve millions of users worldwide.
