It will be on Random Forests, and our speaker will be Toh Wei Zhong. About : Random Forests are built up from classification / regression trees. By randomly selecting predictors and creating an ensemble of trees (i.e. the forest), we are able to greatly increase the predictive capability of the method. In this talk, Wei Zhong will go into the details of the methodology, starting with the terminology all the way up to tuning the hyperparameters. We will end the workshop with a code walkthrough. About Wei Zhong: Wei Zhong is a graduate from the computational biology department at NUS. An ardent R user, he currently works as a data scientist at NCS.

We're back this month with our Maker Series and another amazing speaker - Cindy Lin. You can check out her previous work at: http://cindylin.org/ Snails, herbs and Ibu-Ibu: Recounting transnational tinkering moments Cindy Lin will present her previous artistic and citizen science outputs in residencies and transnational collaborations across Europe and Asia where snails, herbs and older women find meeting points. She will also recount her experience working as an ethnographer in various hackerspaces and makerspaces, highlighting the cultural particularities of making and hacking in her research sites. Details: 730pm, Wednesday, 15 July 2015 IDA Labs Level 2 @ National Design Centre 111 Middle Road, #02-04, 188969 BIO: Cindy Lin is a researcher dedicated to the study of shared technological and scientific spaces, vernacular technologies and intergenerational knowledge exchanges in the Global South. Her previous ethnographic work involved extensive fieldwork on the politics of DIY maker and hacker culture in Indonesia and the flows of scientific and technological information across nation-state boundaries. She will be a PhD Student at the School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor this Fall 2015. She co-founded Gender Collective, a safe space for gender and sexual inclusivity in 2011 and is co-editor of an independent semi-academic Southeast Asian Studies journal in 2013, Subjectivities. She has also recently initiated Sewon FoodLab, a transnational collaboration with geeks from Indonesia to critically think, experiment and discuss about consumable matter. A moonlighting student and a bio-enthusiast, Cindy is obsessed with both alive and dead gastropoda and rodentia as well as invasive alien species.
