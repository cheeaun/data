Very few involve actually creating your own BLE peripheral itself. After my presentation, you will get an introduction on how to program your own BLE peripheral based on an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Basic iOS and Android BLE code will also be covered. Kheng Meng is a graduating student from NUS Comp Science faculty; he currently works at AlgoAccess, a med-tech start-up providing solutions to Opticians, Optometrists and Ophthalmologists and he enjoys innovating at the juncture of hardware and software.","location":"Plug-In@Blk71","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/466440616841706","group_name":"Hackers and Painters","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/326203847521210","formatted_time":"10 Apr 2015, Fri, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2015-04-10T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-04-10T05:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"221387029","name":"SoftLayer Developer Workshop","description":"Registration: EventBrite </a> Spend time with SoftLayer mentors and equip your startup's tech teams with the knowledge and technical know-how to scale your technical needs with efficiency and stability.

At the Open Source Society (OSS), it also means the end of term for the present Management Committee. Over the past year, we have done our best to make our club a good platform for students to learn skills outside of the curriculum, demonstrate their capacity for invention, connect with other technically inclined and like-minded people and with the industry. We have worked towards that vision via TGIFHacks, a weekly series of workshops, project demonstrations and company talks. Through TGIFHacks, we hope to achieve our long term objective of being a student community helping to attract students of common technical interests to foster a community of engineers, hackers and builders to explore their interests in technology and share their knowledge and expertise with others. This Friday, at our last TGIFHacks for this semester we will be having our final event, the Annual General Meeting 2015, in order to select the next batch of leaders, who will guide the club in future. As a member of the OSS, we believe that you should have a say in your expectations from the club. Therefore, we would like to invite you to this year’s AGM 2015 to help us choose the new Management Committee whom you think will be able to take the OSS to greater heights. Details of the event are as follows: Date: Friday, 10 April 2015 Time: 6.30pm onwards Venue: TR+37 Drinks and snacks will be served. Please indicate your attendance here so that we can make provisions. We would like to thank you for your continued support of the OSS and its activities throughout the year and we look forward to seeing you at the AGM 2015.","location":"TR+37","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1048405305189494","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/219467331408976","formatted_time":"10 Apr 2015, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2015-04-10T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-04-10T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"356672161209020","name":"Friday Hacks #92 - Web Developers' Nightmare","description":"We'll be having three security researchers from the Ministry of Home Affairs -- Jacob, Glenn and Damian -- speaking about Web Security this week. See you! Free pizza is served before the talks. Talk description One of the main reason why there are lots of web vulnerabilities nowadays are because many developers are not trained or are not exposed to web security. This talk aims to provide a collection of common security mistakes that are found in web applications. Topics covered ranges from design mistakes to implementation mistakes. Common security vulnerabilites like Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection will also be discussed. This talk would help attendees gain a better understanding of these issues and hopefully help them develop more secured applications. At the end, we will also discuss about security issues surrounding NoSQL databases. Speaker profile Jacob Soo - Head of Research and Analysis Team Jacob's responsibilities include analyzing malware and carrying out security research. He is also known for his work on Android Reversing. Here, he served as head of software security and was in charge of the malware analysis framework and is responsible for both monitoring the regional malware situation and in-depth analysis of cyber incidents. Damian Ong - Senior Security Researcher, Research and Analysis Team Damian is responsible for monitoring the malware threat landscape. He specializes in web security, malware, and threats which target Government systems, including phishing. He is involved in several innovative research projects, ranging from malware databases or honeypots to web crawlers. Glenn Ng - Senior Security Researcher, Research and Analysis Team Glenn is a specialist in cyber and advanced persistent threats and defense, penetration testing, malware landscape. He mostly focuses on reverse-engineering and in-depth analysis of contemporary advanced threats. His area of interest includes analysing exploits for Windows systems and embedded platforms.
