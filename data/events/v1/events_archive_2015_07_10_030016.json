Haskell is notorious for its steep learning curve, but weâ€™ll fast track your entry into the Haskell world by going over a decent set of exercises. Fun! The Plan * Set up a dev environment: * Cabal sandboxes * Grokking basic haskell syntax * Basic mental models, programming constructs and data handling (types) * Interesting things about Haskell (touching upon some advanced topics) Getting ready for the workshop Install the haskell-platform.
