SOLID is currently one of the leading system integrator for Large Scale Solar Thermal (LST) installations and has worldwide experience in designing, installing & commissioning LST systems adapted to local climates that have not a single failed system in more than 250 installations during the past 2 decades. Harald has over 7 years experience as a speaker on different international conferences and also held various trainings on Solar Thermal topics in Europe & Africa. He has also recently completed a six month stint in Singapore as the Head of SOLID’s Research & Development Team which jointly established a Solar Thermal research laboratory with Energy Research Institute @ Nanyang Technological University (ERI@N). About the Workshop: Singapore is a small city-state without natural resources such as oil and natural gas. Fortunately, we are blessed with plenty of sunshine throughout the year. When adopting a renewal solar energy system, a Large scale Solar Thermal (LST) system helps to reduce the use of fossil fuels and improves the building environmental performance. LST systems which convert the Free & Sustainable Solar Energy from the Sun to produce energy in the form of (Solar Thermal) Heat are designed to provide energy input directly to meet the local consumer’s energy requirement. Hence, a LST system helps not only to reduce the reliance on the conventional energy inputs, ie. electricity and natural gas, but could also be independent & enjoy security from any future dramatic changes in oil prices. Singapore is also a land scarce country and the optimization of available spaces is of utmost importance when evaluating the adoption of the most technologically feasible and economically viable renewable energy system. Apart from being more efficient in harvesting solar energy as compared to other alternatives, a LST system is very simple to operate and has a long operating life requiring minimum maintenance thus making a LST system an attractive renewable system that is able to optimize the use of space in Singapore. A LST system will also make the building unique and further enhances the owner’s Clean & Green image. Apart from various attractive project financing schemes from banks & other international financial institution at competitive rates, aspiring LST system end-users could tap into the alternative Energy Service Contracting (ESCo) option that offer minimum upfront investments. An ESCo is structured as a service that not only reduce operating costs & transfer risk but also allow building owners to concentrate attention on their core activities. Many aspiring LST systems owners find themselves poorly prepared when requesting system proposals and evaluating offers, as they might have little or no prior experience of LST systems and what levels of payback and incentive schemes apply. Hence, two experienced Solar Thermal industry professionals are invited to clear your doubts. Objectives of the workshop: At the end of the programme, participants will understand: • the fundamentals of Solar Thermal technology • the difference between Solar Thermal and Solar PV technologies • the possibilities and limitations of Solar Thermal applications in Data Center and Commercial buildings. • the economics and payback of Large Scale Solar Thermal (LST) systems • how to specify and evaluate LST project proposals Target Audience • Data Center Facility Managers • Building owners • Developers • Architects • Contractors • Government agencies Programme Outline The half-day workshop will comprise a mix of presentations and interactive discussions: 1. Technical Topics • Introduction and overview of Solar Thermal Technology and Large Scale Solar Thermal System • Comparison large scale vs small scale, flat plate vs tube • Comparison between Solar Thermal and PV – relevance to land scarce country like Singapore • Applications: Data Center, Commercial Solar Cooling 2. Project Evaluation • Economics and LCOE/ROI analysis • Project Financing • ESCo • Identifying and evaluating projects • Maintenance requirements and programmes 3.
