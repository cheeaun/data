MasterCard hackathon is taking place in Singapore on March 28-29. Use the code HackAngel for free tickets. http://bit.ly/mocsg The CONCEPT How is a truly gifted Coder (as in programmers, designers and developers) distinguished today? For thousands of years, master artisans were honored with an insignia in recognition of their talent. A distinct object such as a pin or hat established their dominance in a field. “Coders”, as we define them here, have become the world’s newest artisans. Just as master builders were essential for the creation of a business 400 years ago, Coders are needed for everything from website creation to server maintenance and developing new in-house platforms. Yet there is no identifying seal showcasing the quality of Coders, their rank amongst peers or even their trials and accomplishments. Enter the MasterCard Masters of Code Competition. Through this intense series of hackathons we have one goal: to traverse the globe and engage the very best Coders. Each regional hackathon will have developers, designers and entrepreneurs using the MasterCard APIs to create masterful prototypes that demonstrate artful coding and design skills, while articulating clear business cases. The competition will be intense and the tension high, but we are looking to create a different experience for our participants. Each event will be held in one of the most thriving tech communities worldwide – and at the best venues there. Winners from each region will be flown out for the Grand Finale Masters of Code Hackathon in Silicon Valley to experience a MasterCard Priceless Experience – Northern California. The final itself will be just like the regionals with up to ten teams from the region events and one MasterCard elite team of Coders. The winning team will be recognized as the first Masters of Code Champions and given their Masters of Code Jackets, $100,000 and many other perks. Only the global winning team will be given this honor and privilege. THE COMPETITION Regional Level: Each region has a specific Challenge, Featured API and Secret API that attendees can go after. While you don't have to use all three in your hack, bonus points will be awarded to those that do. The Singapore Challenge: Using Commerce/Payments to Empower Women The Singapore Featured API: Simplify Commerce The Singapore Secret API: Shh, you'll have to wait for the event to find that out... PRIZES Grand Prize* The MasterCard Masters of Code Champions will be crowned and will receive $100,000 to develop their innovation, in addition to the following prizes*: Two weeks on-site at the MasterCard Start Path™ accelerator location in Dublin, Ireland, or an alternate remote program Six months of mentoring from a member of the MasterCard Open API executive team and the Start Path program team Free payment processing for up to $250,000 in transactions for the first 12 months using Simplify Commerce**.. *Prizes may be modified to accommodate regional availability and regulations of the winning team location **Legal Disclaimer: To qualify for this promotion, a Masters of Code team must apply to become and be approved as a Simplify Commerce merchant and actively transact via Simplify Commerce Gateway. “Actively transact means conducting a sales transaction that results in Simplify Commerce making a deposit to the checking account you have linked to your Simplify Commerce merchant account. If you qualify, Simplify Commerce will rebate the 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction processing fee for your first $250,000 in sales that occurs within 12 months after the company becomes a Simplify Commerce merchant. Should a transaction be refunded, it will not be eligible for a rebate. After the company reaches $250,000 in sales, processing fees will remain 2.85% + 30¢ per transaction (or the standard rate at that time).

You are probably in the right place. Registration RSVP yes if you can commit that whole afternoon to code and answered yes on the 4 prerequisites below. Four Prerequisites 1. Read the book Working Effectively with Legacy Code or otherwise, read a short article about it. 2. Already understood why writing automated unit tests and Test-Driven Development is beneficial. 3. Have experience working in Java, C# or other similar Object-Oriented programming language 4.

How do you deal with that more effectively? We're going to spend four solid afternoon hours to practice how to work more effectively with legacy code by having coding dojo with the Trivia Game. This code kata is used in Legacy Code Retreat and you can find the source codes here github.com/jbrains/trivia . At the end, the legacy code should become cleaner and easier to understand. A lot of the methods used will be based on Michael Feathers' Working Effectively with Legacy Code . We will spend most of the time experimenting different strategies and see how it affect the code readability and design. How does it work? • Coding dojo randori • 2 groups of 6-8 people size of different programming language. • at the end of the day, do the Code Retreat Closing Circle: gather everyone together in a circle, then go one by one sharing something about the day What legacy code do we work on? https://github.com/agilesingapore/coding_dojo_legacy_code ","location":"Odd-e Singapore - Goodland Building, 18 Roberts Lane, #05-01","url":"http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Singapore/events/220817667/","group_name":"Agile Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Agile-Singapore","formatted_time":"28 Mar 2015, Sat, 1:00 pm","start_time":"2015-03-28T05:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-03-28T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"15794221943","name":"试一下","description":"Lorem ipsum","location":"Qiushi Li, , Test, #02-77, blk177, clementi street 13, Singapore 120117","url":"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/15794221943?aff=ebapi","group_name":"InvitroCue Pte Ltd","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/7948492680/","formatted_time":"28 Mar 2015, Sat, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-03-28T11:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-03-28T14:00:00Z"},{"id":3,"name":"Battlehack","description":"Sessions Xiaodan is sharing a case study of millennium hotel where the design was well received by the clients and users.
