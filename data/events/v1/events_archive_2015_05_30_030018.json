There are a few trees and a bit of open space, very good for proximity flying and racing practice. It's about a 10 minute walk from Stadium MRT if you are travelling by public transport, and there is a carpark nearby if you're coming by car. If you have difficulty finding us then contact me by whatsapp/sms: +6591001743 This event will be focusing mostly on 250 Class FPV Racers, and will be great for people looking to hone their flying skills, meet other racers, or just to learn about FPV Racing and how to go about building a fast, agile, FPV Racer.
