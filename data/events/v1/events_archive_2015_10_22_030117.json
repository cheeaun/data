Thibault Weintraub has already presented for us back in December last year. We had interviewed him here. In addition to be a great Java programmer, he is also a secret fan of Node.JS.Thibault will take us a side by side comparison between Java/Spring and Node.JS. As you will see, not everything should be done with Node.JS. But there are some situations in which it is much easier to use than Java. \n\n\nTalk 2: migrating a monolith app to microservices Carlos Queiroz has done lots of work on microservices and Spring Cloud in the past few months. He will be starting from a monolith Spring app and will show you how it can be migrated step by step to a series of lightweight micro-services using Spring Cloud for the communication between services.","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/225862673/","group_id":13661682,"group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"22 Oct 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-10-22T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-22T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"225606684","name":"WordPress Meetup (Oct 2015)","description":"It's time for another meetup!
