This time we will be reading the book High Performance Web Sites together. Here is the description about the book: Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Format for the book club: 1. Buy the book and read the Chapter BEFORE the meetup. 2. Pick an Item from the Chapter and prepare some discussion points and/or questions. 3. Let the rest of us know which Item you picked by leaving a comment.

The other talk will be by Kailash Nath one of our best Hadoop expert at Pivotal Asia. Find details about both talks below: 6:45 - 7:15 :: Food and networking 7:15 - 8:45 :: Talks and Q&A 8:45 - 9:00 :: Mingling -------------- Talk Title: Build Cloud Native applications Speaker: Sergiu Bodiu, Sr. Solution Architect, Pivotal Abstract: There’s a certain “dark ages” between the waning days of Java and .Net and the renaissance we have now with PaaS and other microservices-think driven platforms. \"GoldPlating\" That's right, friend. Before long, you'll discover that almost any problem can be made more complicated! Tap into the unemptyable wells of PrematureComplexity & AccidentalComplexity, and have a heyday! Fortunately many of the innovators in the space, including Twitter, LinkedIn, and Netflix, have embraced the JVM as they’ve built increasingly complex systems. Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems. Spring Boot is a micro framework for micro service applications. With the advent of microservice and cloud-native application architectures, building distributed systems is becoming increasingly common for the enterprise Java developer. About: Sergiu is a seasoned consultant experienced in large-scale e-commerce projects, passionate about providing innovative technology solutions to solve complex business problems, have extensive knowledge and experience delivering enterprise wide applications. ===================== Talk Title: \"Implementing Hadoop in a large enterprise - experience sharing\" Speaker: Kailash Nath, Technical Architect, Pivotal \"Yay! I see the elephant in the room\". It took a real long time for those \"strategists\" to accept the fact that there is an elephant in the room. How many of them really see the full elephant? Business intelligence has been used by architects for assessing architecture model and correct EA strategy all along. And so pattern like distributed computing is nothing new for them. Yet, why Hadoop/big data initiative fail or don't impress while nextgen Silicon valley enterprises make software that is eating the world using these tools? Data analytics use cases are often IT teams view of business rather than business use case defined by business users. If you don't have a big data business use case sponsored by business user, stop your project right now and save money/energy of those highly paid Hadoop experts. About: Kailash is a Technical architect with 14+ years of industry experience. Prior to joining Pivotal, he has lead the big data initiative for a large airline company and has worked 3 years on some of the largest Hadoop projects. His experience includes end to end architecture and design of large scale OLTP system like B2B e-Commerce platform, large scale integrations solutions, mobile commerce platform, high volume OLAP solutions etc. ","location":"PayPal office in Millenia Tower, 1 Temasek Avenue Millenia Tower #14-01, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/220813250/","group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"09 Apr 2015, Thu, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2015-04-09T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-04-09T12:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"221180029","name":"Xamarin Forms and Azure Storage - Azure & SGDotNET User Groups @ 9-April 7:00pm","description":"Invitation for User Group meeting (9th April) and Azure Bootcamp on (25th April) The UG leads of both Azure and SGdotNet have gotten together and organizing the events together.

Come join us for a weekend of working with data to do good! RSVP to work alongside experts in the field to analyze, visualize, and mash-up the data from our non-profit partners. If we don't know you already, please tell us a bit more about yourself by filling in this Google form ! Non-Profit Organizations 1) Earth Hour World Wildlife Fund ’s Earth Hour is a global environmental movement with a core vision to create environmental impact by utilizing the power of the crowd. Started seven years ago, Earth Hour has grown to become the world’s largest mass participation event in history: celebrated in over 7,000 cities, across 7 continents and by hundreds of millions of people. Earth Hour will take place around the world on 28 Mar 2015 (Sat, 8.30 - 9.30 pm). 2) Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME) Founded in 2004, the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) serves the needs of the migrant worker community in Singapore by developing research and education on the socioeconomics of migration in Singapore and the countries of origin, providing social integration services for emigrants and immigrants, and providing humanitarian assistance for the effects of 'crisis' migration. There are more than 1.3 million documented migrant workers or more in Singapore, of which about 1.1 million are low-wage workers. HOME has provided services to more than 50,000 migrant workers through its provision of shelters, legal assistance, health education training and rehabilitative services. Special thanks to Fuji Xerox Singapore for being our venue sponsor! Schedule Friday, Apr 24th 7.15 pm: Doors open, sign-in 7.45 pm: Introduction to Non-Profit Organizations and Datasets 8.15 pm: Pitching for teams 8.30 pm: Formation of teams It's a great chance to learn about the non-profits and their data, meet the other volunteers you'll be working and talk with others from our partner causes. Plus, there will be snacks and drinks! Saturday, Apr 25th 9 am: Doors open, sign-in and breakfast 9.30 am: Brief review from Data Ambassadors, then data diving! 12.30 pm: Lunch 1 pm: Open Roundtables 6 pm: Dinner 9 pm: Everybody goes home for the night Saturday we'll start work on the data! DataDivers will choose which problems they'd like to work on and form teams around their individual questions. There will be roving DataKind project team leads who will help advise on and manage the projects throughout the day. Sunday, Apr 26th 9 am: Doors open, breakfast 12 noon: Presentations from teams to social organizations 2 pm: Another successful DataDive in the books! This is your chance to show the world what you have done with data! There is no expectation of slides or other presentation materials, simply use whatever method of conveying your work to the organizations you feel is best. This is also the chance for our non-profit partners to better understand what your team did. These presentations can be single or group work, but they can be no longer than 10 minutes each. We want to give everyone a chance to speak, and get people out at a reasonable time. Other items of note for the weekend Volunteers at all levels are welcome throughout the weekend . If you're already a pro, we're looking for some subject-area experts to help with project preparation and be resources throughout the DataDive. Unlike a hackathon, the goal is not (necessarily) to create an app, and it is not a competition. Instead, the objective is to work with teams of experts to understand a truly difficult problem through data. You could end up with a visualization, an analysis, some graphs, or even just some new datasets by the end of the event, and all of those are fantastic results! There is a Github repository setup to use for sharing code, data, and analyses during the event . This will be our primary resource for capturing everything developed at the DataDive, so please use it for sharing and collaboration. We do not assign you to a problem . We want you to work with the problem and data you feel most passionate about, so come Friday with an open mind and be ready to learn. You do not have to stay the entire weekend to participate in the event . We hope that you will find a project you can dig into, but you are always welcome to come and go as you please. You do not have to work on the same project for the whole weekend . Again, we hope that you will find a project to work on to completion, but if at any point you feel like you want to change simply let the DataKind project team lead for your team know. We do not provide any hardware or software for you to use . We'll have the data and some services set up (hackpad, Github), but otherwise you should bring your own laptop and come ready to use whatever data tools you like. See you there!

This conference will offer a different point of view, encouraging an exploration of da Vinci's way of thinking and of the cultural landscape, which nurtured him. It will analyze how his interdisciplinary approach, which we now refer to as “systems thinking” and \"complexity\", remains strikingly resonant for us today, and applied within the fields of art, science, technology, architecture and foresight. The conference begins with a special edition of ArtScience Museum's monthly performance programme, ArtScience late (Thursday 7 May), and continues for two full days of discussions on 8-9 May, featuring presentations from within Singapore and around the world, from a range of leading speakers in the fields of science, history, technology, and architecture.
