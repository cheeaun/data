A working laptop and power supply. Is this free? Yes! We provide tea, coffee and milo and usually something for dinner. Can I come if I'm not a woman? Like Rails Girls, the Ruby Tea Party is designed for women and anyone who self-identifies as a woman. Men are most welcome as a participant's +1 . Is there an age limit? Nope! I know nothing about programming, is this for me? Yes! We are happy to teach anyone with any experience, if you are a quick learner that makes it even better.
