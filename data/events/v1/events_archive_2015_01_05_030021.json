It doesn’t really matter if you are a beginner or an advanced user of Adobe Illustrator, the hottest topic would be about why Adobe Illustrator takes so long to load and save a file. In this session, Mark Plunkett - Director and Designer of Dexel, a graphic design agency will share about some of his most used tips and features during projects at his workplace. ===================== Creative design tools for Mobile App Developers By Arul Kumaran Hear from Arul Kumaran, CTO and Multiplatform Developer at Luracast Singapore to share his experience on the design and development of mobile applications. Developers will also need to know design tools well in order to better market their apps. In this session, you will explore some of the techniques using image editing tool, Adobe Photoshop and screen design tool, Adobe Fireworks on developing mobile apps. He will also share some of the plugins that can make them even more powerful and helpful for the given tasks. ===================== Allow your designs to shine By Linus Lim One of the design principles is to create order and hierarchy in your designs resulting in beautiful and easy to read layouts. In this session you will learn the tips to apply alignments into your designs to give them a professional edge. Icons are used everywhere in user interfaces for websites and mobile apps. The design principle for designing icons is to keep them simple, modern and friendly. Linus will also share how he draws icons for your screen design.","location":"Toa Payoh Public Library","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/324763197721363","group_name":"Creative Crew Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/14431580201","formatted_time":"13 Jan 2015, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-01-13T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-13T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"345733302298770","name":"InDesign Hacks and Variable Data","description":" ======================== Registration Details (at Xerox Building) ========================= Registration starts from 5.45pm, please proceed immediately to level 4, Fuji Xerox Tower at Anson Road.

In 1994, Professor Schmidt and Professor Nicholas Suntzeff formed the HighZ SN search team, a group of 20 astronomers on five continents who used distant exploding stars to trace the expansion of the Universe back in time. The group’s discovery of an accelerating Universe was a startling one suggesting that an unknown force is countering the effect of gravity and pushing the Universe apart.  \nProfessor Schmidt continues his work using exploding stars to study the Universe, and is leading Australian National University’s Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics’ effort to build the SkyMapper telescope. \nAs part of the International Peace Foundation’s “Bridges – Dialogues Towards a Culture of Peace” speaker series at NUS, Professor Schmidt will also undertake engagements with Yale-NUS College. \n  \n\n  \n“Science: Humanity’s Universal Bridge”  \nScience is one of the few arenas where humanity has worked together through history for our collective good. In his speech, Professor Schmidt will discuss the role of science through the ages in shaping our current society, reflecting on the good and the bad its knowledge has brought. While science's impact in our daily lives is higher now than ever before, to cope with future challenges the world will need further improve how it works together. It is through continual advances in our knowledge that we can hope to have the billions of the world's inhabitants live in peace and prosperity into the future.","location":"Shaw Foundation Alumni House Auditorium, Level 2, 11 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119244","url":"http://nusbridges.eventbrite.sg/?aff=ebapi","group_name":"National University of Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/7684522735/","formatted_time":"21 Jan 2015, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-01-21T11:30:00Z","end_time":"2015-01-21T13:30:00Z"},{"id":"15003012414","name":"\"Future Cities: Prospects and Projections\"@Urban Lab","description":"Join us for the launch of Urban Lab, a new dedicated exhibition space by URA that profiles the most innovative solutions for a sustainable and liveable urban environment.
