It’s all about Zooming Ahead! Throw out those Servers, Bring in the Cloud! - Marc Jones, Chief Technology Officer, SoftLayer One of the biggest challenges for startups, no matter how brilliant the idea or, how innovative the app, is dealing with the technical side of business. Not only are you expected to get that out-of-the-box idea, plan for it, seek investors for it but you also have to seek the right technical infrastructure to take it to the masses. Well, who says you have to be technical to get that business off the ground. With everything on the cloud all you need to know about IT systems is click, point, order - and hey presto, your systems are up and running in minutes and hours, not days and months! It’s a Cloud fest - Spend time with Marc Jones as he takes us through what are the latest products in the market and what other startups are doing with the technology.

One talk will be by - Sergiu Bodiu , a Sr. Solution Architect on the Pivotal team, about building cloud native applications. The other talk will be by Kailash Nath one of our best Hadoop expert at Pivotal Asia. Find details about both talks below: 6:45 - 7:15 :: Food and networking 7:15 - 8:45 :: Talks and Q&A 8:45 - 9:00 :: Mingling -------------- Talk Title: Build Cloud Native applications Speaker: Sergiu Bodiu, Sr. Solution Architect, Pivotal Abstract: There’s a certain “dark ages” between the waning days of Java and .Net and the renaissance we have now with PaaS and other microservices-think driven platforms. \"GoldPlating\" That's right, friend. Before long, you'll discover that almost any problem can be made more complicated! Tap into the unemptyable wells of PrematureComplexity & AccidentalComplexity, and have a heyday! Fortunately many of the innovators in the space, including Twitter, LinkedIn, and Netflix, have embraced the JVM as they’ve built increasingly complex systems. Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems. Spring Boot is a micro framework for micro service applications. With the advent of microservice and cloud-native application architectures, building distributed systems is becoming increasingly common for the enterprise Java developer. About: Sergiu is a seasoned consultant experienced in large-scale e-commerce projects, passionate about providing innovative technology solutions to solve complex business problems, have extensive knowledge and experience delivering enterprise wide applications. ===================== Talk Title: \"Implementing Hadoop in a large enterprise - experience sharing\" Speaker: Kailash Nath, Technical Architect, Pivotal (we have interviewed Kailash here ). \"Yay! I see the elephant in the room\". It took a real long time for those \"strategists\" to accept the fact that there is an elephant in the room. How many of them really see the full elephant? Business intelligence has been used by architects for assessing architecture model and correct EA strategy all along. And so pattern like distributed computing is nothing new for them. Yet, why Hadoop/big data initiative fail or don't impress while nextgen Silicon valley enterprises make software that is eating the world using these tools? Data analytics use cases are often IT teams view of business rather than business use case defined by business users. If you don't have a big data business use case sponsored by business user, stop your project right now and save money/energy of those highly paid Hadoop experts. About: Kailash is a Technical architect with 14+ years of industry experience. Prior to joining Pivotal, he has lead the big data initiative for a large airline company and has worked 3 years on some of the largest Hadoop projects. His experience includes end to end architecture and design of large scale OLTP system like B2B e-Commerce platform, large scale integrations solutions, mobile commerce platform, high volume OLAP solutions etc. ","location":"PayPal office in Millenia Tower, 1 Temasek Avenue Millenia Tower #14-01, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/220813250/","group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"09 Apr 2015, Thu, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2015-04-09T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-04-09T12:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"221180029","name":"Xamarin Forms and Azure Storage - Azure & SGDotNET User Groups @ 9-April 7:00pm","description":"Invitation for User Group meeting (9th April) and Azure Bootcamp on (25th April) The UG leads of both Azure and SGdotNet have gotten together and organizing the events together.

See you! Free pizza is served before the talks. Talk description One of the main reason why there are lots of web vulnerabilities nowadays are because many developers are not trained or are not exposed to web security. This talk aims to provide a collection of common security mistakes that are found in web applications. Topics covered ranges from design mistakes to implementation mistakes. Common security vulnerabilites like Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection will also be discussed. This talk would help attendees gain a better understanding of these issues and hopefully help them develop more secured applications. At the end, we will also discuss about security issues surrounding NoSQL databases. Speaker profile Jacob Soo - Head of Research and Analysis Team Jacob's responsibilities include analyzing malware and carrying out security research. He is also known for his work on Android Reversing.

At the Open Source Society (OSS), it also means the end of term for the present Management Committee. Over the past year, we have done our best to make our club a good platform for students to learn skills outside of the curriculum, demonstrate their capacity for invention, connect with other technically inclined and like-minded people and with the industry. We have worked towards that vision via TGIFHacks, a weekly series of workshops, project demonstrations and company talks. Through TGIFHacks, we hope to achieve our long term objective of being a student community helping to attract students of common technical interests to foster a community of engineers, hackers and builders to explore their interests in technology and share their knowledge and expertise with others. This Friday, at our last TGIFHacks for this semester we will be having our final event, the Annual General Meeting 2015, in order to select the next batch of leaders, who will guide the club in future. As a member of the OSS, we believe that you should have a say in your expectations from the club. Therefore, we would like to invite you to this year’s AGM 2015 to help us choose the new Management Committee whom you think will be able to take the OSS to greater heights.

Here is the description about the book: Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser.

Come join us for a weekend of working with data to do good! RSVP to work alongside experts in the field to analyze, visualize, and mash-up the data from our non-profit partners. If we don't know you already, please tell us a bit more about yourself by filling in this Google form ! Non-Profit Organizations 1) Earth Hour World Wildlife Fund ’s Earth Hour is a global environmental movement with a core vision to create environmental impact by utilizing the power of the crowd. Started seven years ago, Earth Hour has grown to become the world’s largest mass participation event in history: celebrated in over 7,000 cities, across 7 continents and by hundreds of millions of people. Earth Hour recently took place around the world on 28 Mar 2015 (Sat, 8.30 - 9.30 pm). 2) Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME) Founded in 2004, the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) serves the needs of the migrant worker community in Singapore by developing research and education on the socioeconomics of migration in Singapore and the countries of origin, providing social integration services for emigrants and immigrants, and providing humanitarian assistance for the effects of 'crisis' migration. There are more than 1.3 million documented migrant workers or more in Singapore, of which about 1.1 million are low-wage workers. HOME has provided services to more than 50,000 migrant workers through its provision of shelters, legal assistance, health education training and rehabilitative services. Special thanks to Fuji Xerox Singapore for being our venue sponsor! Schedule Friday, Apr 24th 7.15 pm: Doors open, sign-in (we're on the 4th floor!) 7.45 pm: Introduction to Non-Profit Organizations and Datasets 8.15 pm: Pitching for teams 8.30 pm: Formation of teams It's a great chance to learn about the non-profits and their data, meet the other volunteers you'll be working and talk with others from our partner causes. Plus, there will be snacks and drinks! Saturday, Apr 25th 9 am: Doors open, sign-in and breakfast 9.30 am: Brief review from Data Ambassadors, then data diving! 12.30 pm: Lunch 1 pm: Open Roundtables 6 pm: Dinner 9 pm: Everybody goes home for the night Saturday we'll start work on the data! DataDivers will choose which problems they'd like to work on and form teams around their individual questions. There will be roving DataKind project team leads who will help advise on and manage the projects throughout the day. Sunday, Apr 26th 9 am: Doors open, breakfast 12 noon: Presentations from teams to social organizations 2 pm: Another successful DataDive in the books! This is your chance to show the world what you have done with data! There is no expectation of slides or other presentation materials, simply use whatever method of conveying your work to the organizations you feel is best. This is also the chance for our non-profit partners to better understand what your team did. These presentations can be single or group work, but they can be no longer than 10 minutes each. We want to give everyone a chance to speak, and get people out at a reasonable time. Other items of note for the weekend Volunteers at all levels are welcome throughout the weekend . If you're already a pro, we're looking for some subject-area experts to help with project preparation and be resources throughout the DataDive. Unlike a hackathon, the goal is not (necessarily) to create an app, and it is not a competition. Instead, the objective is to work with teams of experts to understand a truly difficult problem through data. You could end up with a visualization, an analysis, some graphs, or even just some new datasets by the end of the event, and all of those are fantastic results! There is a Github repository setup to use for sharing code and analyses during the event . This will be our primary resource for capturing everything developed at the DataDive, so please use it for sharing and collaboration. We do not assign you to a problem . We want you to work with the problem and data you feel most passionate about, so come Friday with an open mind and be ready to learn. You do not have to stay the entire weekend to participate in the event . We hope that you will find a project you can dig into, but you are always welcome to come and go as you please. You do not have to work on the same project for the whole weekend . Again, we hope that you will find a project to work on to completion, but if at any point you feel like you want to change simply let the DataKind project team lead for your team know. We do not provide any hardware or software for you to use . We'll have the data and some services set up (hackpad, Github), but otherwise you should bring your own laptop and come ready to use whatever data tools you like. See you there!

Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Format for the book club: 1. Buy the book and read the Chapter (s) BEFORE the meetup. 2. Pick an Item from the Chapter and prepare some discussion points and/or questions. 3. Let the rest of us know which Item you picked by leaving a comment.

Most studies of da Vinci focus on a specific area of his activity - art, anatomy, technology, studies on water, on flight, and so on. This conference will offer a different point of view, encouraging an exploration of da Vinci's way of thinking and of the cultural landscape, which nurtured him. It will analyze how his interdisciplinary approach, which we now refer to as “systems thinking” and \"complexity\", remains strikingly resonant for us today, and applied within the fields of art, science, technology, architecture and foresight. The conference begins with a special edition of ArtScience Museum's monthly performance programme, ArtScience late (Thursday 7 May), and continues for two full days of discussions on 8-9 May, featuring presentations from within Singapore and around the world, from a range of leading speakers in the fields of science, history, technology, and architecture. The conference chairs are Honor Harger (ArtScience Museum) and Andrea Nanetti (Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design and Media and Complexity Institute). Thursday 7 May 2015 7.00 - 10.00pm: ArtScience Late with a special performance from TeZ, our international ArtScience resident. Friday 8 May 2015 10:00am - 7.00pm The first day of the conference presents da Vinci and the approach that he took to all of his lines of enquiries. It analyses how da Vinci not only understood the essence of ‘systems’ thinking, but how he also applied this to his inventions, ideas and work generally. We ask, was this approach extraordinary for its time? Was da Vinci different from his renowned contemporaries in this way? To address these questions, the keynote speaker, Professor Galluzzi will present an overview of da Vinci’s life, influences, influencers and projects in this context, and Professor Fiorani will explore the educational context of da Vinci’s time and place. We will explore if there was something within the context of da Vinci’s time which encouraged his thinking and ‘systems’ awareness, or was this a one-off – a spike in the linear progression of epistemology? We ask if there are there other examples of interdisciplinary thinking and approaches throughout history. The day will continue with a reflection on the more recent times and the advent of new media – a marriage of two seemingly quite separate, established disciplines: art and technology, moving the dialogue into the 20th century, and beyond. Saturday, 9 May 2015 10:00am - 7.00pm The whistle-stop tour through key ‘systems thinkers’ in history from the previous day, which ended with a look at innovation today in Singapore, continues with a day exploring contemporary ‘systems approaches’, specifically addressing the areas of: education and pedagogical methodologies today; and how science and technology can be applied broadly to work through some of the world’s most pressing issues. Fittingly, the last session looks to the future, and how ‘systems thinking’ is being successfully used to address environmental issues – perhaps the biggest threat to the continuing survival of the planet and its inhabitants. And where is Singapore within this landscape?

This time we will be reading the book High Performance Web Sites together and creating interactive exercises to go along with it. Bookclub for the 14th of April: Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5. Michael skipped ahead and gave us a great overview of Chapters 3 and 4 at the previous meetup, so let's make sure everyone has read them plus Chapter 5. Here is the description about the book: Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Format for the book club: 1. Buy the book and read the Chapter (s) BEFORE the meetup. 2. Pick an Item from the Chapter and prepare some discussion points and/or questions. 3. Let the rest of us know which Item you picked by leaving a comment.

This time we will be reading the book High Performance Web Sites together and creating interactive exercises to go along with it. Bookclub for the 14th of April: Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5. Michael skipped ahead and gave us a great overview of Chapters 3 and 4 at the previous meetup, so let's make sure everyone has read them plus Chapter 5. Here is the description about the book: Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process. Format for the book club: 1. Buy the book and read the Chapter (s) BEFORE the meetup. 2. Pick an Item from the Chapter and prepare some discussion points and/or questions. 3. Let the rest of us know which Item you picked by leaving a comment.

This time we will be reading the book High Performance Web Sites together and creating interactive exercises to go along with it. Bookclub for the 14th of April: Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5. Michael skipped ahead and gave us a great overview of Chapters 3 and 4 at the previous meetup, so let's make sure everyone has read them plus Chapter 5. Here is the description about the book: Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser.

This time we will be reading the book High Performance Web Sites together and creating interactive exercises to go along with it. Bookclub for the 14th of April: Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5. Michael skipped ahead and gave us a great overview of Chapters 3 and 4 at the previous meetup, so let's make sure everyone has read them plus Chapter 5. Here is the description about the book: Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines. The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser.
