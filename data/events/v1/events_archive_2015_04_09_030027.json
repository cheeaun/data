It’s all about Zooming Ahead! Throw out those Servers, Bring in the Cloud! - Marc Jones, Chief Technology Officer, SoftLayer One of the biggest challenges for startups, no matter how brilliant the idea or, how innovative the app, is dealing with the technical side of business. Not only are you expected to get that out-of-the-box idea, plan for it, seek investors for it but you also have to seek the right technical infrastructure to take it to the masses. Well, who says you have to be technical to get that business off the ground. With everything on the cloud all you need to know about IT systems is click, point, order - and hey presto, your systems are up and running in minutes and hours, not days and months! It’s a Cloud fest - Spend time with Marc Jones as he takes us through what are the latest products in the market and what other startups are doing with the technology.

One talk will be by - Sergiu Bodiu , a Sr. Solution Architect on the Pivotal team, about building cloud native applications. The other talk will be by Kailash Nath one of our best Hadoop expert at Pivotal Asia. Find details about both talks below: 6:45 - 7:15 :: Food and networking 7:15 - 8:45 :: Talks and Q&A 8:45 - 9:00 :: Mingling -------------- Talk Title: Build Cloud Native applications Speaker: Sergiu Bodiu, Sr. Solution Architect, Pivotal Abstract: There’s a certain “dark ages” between the waning days of Java and .Net and the renaissance we have now with PaaS and other microservices-think driven platforms. \"GoldPlating\" That's right, friend. Before long, you'll discover that almost any problem can be made more complicated! Tap into the unemptyable wells of PrematureComplexity & AccidentalComplexity, and have a heyday! Fortunately many of the innovators in the space, including Twitter, LinkedIn, and Netflix, have embraced the JVM as they’ve built increasingly complex systems. Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems. Spring Boot is a micro framework for micro service applications. With the advent of microservice and cloud-native application architectures, building distributed systems is becoming increasingly common for the enterprise Java developer. About: Sergiu is a seasoned consultant experienced in large-scale e-commerce projects, passionate about providing innovative technology solutions to solve complex business problems, have extensive knowledge and experience delivering enterprise wide applications. ===================== Talk Title: \"Implementing Hadoop in a large enterprise - experience sharing\" Speaker: Kailash Nath, Technical Architect, Pivotal (we have interviewed Kailash here ). \"Yay! I see the elephant in the room\". It took a real long time for those \"strategists\" to accept the fact that there is an elephant in the room. How many of them really see the full elephant? Business intelligence has been used by architects for assessing architecture model and correct EA strategy all along. And so pattern like distributed computing is nothing new for them. Yet, why Hadoop/big data initiative fail or don't impress while nextgen Silicon valley enterprises make software that is eating the world using these tools? Data analytics use cases are often IT teams view of business rather than business use case defined by business users. If you don't have a big data business use case sponsored by business user, stop your project right now and save money/energy of those highly paid Hadoop experts. About: Kailash is a Technical architect with 14+ years of industry experience. Prior to joining Pivotal, he has lead the big data initiative for a large airline company and has worked 3 years on some of the largest Hadoop projects. His experience includes end to end architecture and design of large scale OLTP system like B2B e-Commerce platform, large scale integrations solutions, mobile commerce platform, high volume OLAP solutions etc. ","location":"PayPal office in Millenia Tower, 1 Temasek Avenue Millenia Tower #14-01, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/220813250/","group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"09 Apr 2015, Thu, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2015-04-09T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-04-09T12:45:00.000Z"},{"id":"221180029","name":"Xamarin Forms and Azure Storage - Azure & SGDotNET User Groups @ 9-April 7:00pm","description":"Invitation for User Group meeting (9th April) and Azure Bootcamp on (25th April) The UG leads of both Azure and SGdotNet have gotten together and organizing the events together.
