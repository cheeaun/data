As such, Alex and I are organising a series of tutorials on the top data mining algorithms. The content of the talks will aim to cover a little understanding of the theory, but will mostly focus on examples with R. The 8 - 10 algorithms we aim to cover include: • k-means • SVM • Apriori • Naive Bayes • Random forests and decision/regression trees • EM • kNN • AdaBoost We intend for the sessions to be held on a monthly basis, lasting about an hour or so. The venue will be 237 South Bridge Road. We’ll have to collect SGD 5 a head, but this goes toward the venue and refreshments (not into our pockets =)). We'll collect it at the door on the day itself. The speakers for the talks will be our very own RUGS members. If you are an expert in one of the topics and would like to conduct the session, do let us know! For the first talk, Alex will be speaking about SVM. Here is a short overview of the talk, and a little bit about Alex too About SVM: SVM is nowadays one of the most popular classification algorithms. It is efficient in dealing big data set. It allows us to fit nonlinear classification boundary with kernel methods. Moreover, the combination of penalization and “customized” kernel enable us to introduce prior knowledge into classification. In this R share session, we will quickly go through the theoretical part of SVM, and demonstrate the application with R package “kernlab”. And last but not least, we will show 2 examples to let you feel the power of SVM. About Alex: I am a statistician in HSOR@NHG. I have been studying statistics for 6 years and using R for 6 years. My research areas are statistical learning, computing statistics, data visualization and data science with population health management.
