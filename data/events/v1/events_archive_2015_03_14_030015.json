No problem! This is a half day event for complete beginners. Using recorded content from the Microsoft Virtual Academy and demonstrations from a PowerShell MVP and the User Group Leads, you'll finish the day much more confident with PowerShell than you were before. We have been hearing from the Community that there are not enough sessions for Beginners, also, some people are not confident about using PowerShell because they haven't had a good enough grounding in the fundamentals. We would like to address that. What are we doing at this Meet Up? This meet up is intended for those who want to get started with the basics of PowerShell. As PowerShell is not a new technology, there are many really awesome resources out there to get started. As such, we don't believe it is worth re-inventing the wheel. One of the best resources out there are the Microsoft Virtual Academy courses by the inventor of PowerShell Jeffrey Snover and MVP Jason Helmick which take you through as much as you need to get started. In this meet up we will be screening much of the content from Getting Started with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start . This is an opportunity for those who have been interested in viewing this online but who haven't had time, or those who have watched it but are still a little unsure on some topics to go through it with us in an environment free of distractions. At the end of each module you'll be able to ask questions to clarify anything you're not sure of and we'll discuss, demo and bash keyboards until you feel you've mastered it! The day should follow along the lines of: • Welcome to the Session and set the scene - what is PowerShell, why so important and what are we doing here • Screen content from the MVA course, answer the quiz questions, do Q&A, any Demo's & further explanation • LUNCH! • Screen more videos • Wrap up and talk about what's next • Home Sweet Home All in all we will cover the Help System , the Pipeline , understanding Objects and Remoting . Having a sound grounding and solid understanding of these concepts will propel you forwards with your PowerShell Learning! Wait, why should I attend when I could watch this online?! Yes, you absolutely could watch this online in your own time, we believe the reasons to attend are: • To connect with like-minded people in the community that you don't connect with from behind your screen • Have the ability to ask questions when there is something you don't understand • Get a free lunch! • Have time and space free from the distractions of home or work to really concentrate, watch the material and learn it Is this a proper training event? Not really. User Groups should be seen as places to network and gather with like-minded folks and learn a little along the way. We don't make any commitment to turn you into experts and you only get out as much as you put in, but we commit to sharing our knowledge to help you improve and hope you will commit to sharing your knowledge with the group as well. So, what should I expect from this? Meet other PowerShell Enthusiasts. Be introduced to some great learning resources. To be given the time and distraction-free environment to learn from the Microsoft Virtual Academy. Lunch. How do I get the most from this? Bring your laptop - the best way to learn is by doing! Watch Video 1 from the Getting Started with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start course. Be on time. Ask questions and participate Please remember this is aimed at Complete Beginners and all content will be at that level, though Intermediate folks may learn some tips and tricks along the way also.

In 2013, bunnie announced that he, in collaboration with Sean 'xobs' Cross , was at work on a laptop called Novena . The laptop is expected to be the first of its kind. The hardware and software for the Novena are entirely open and only include components where the manufacturing companies do not require non-disclosure agreements to obtain the documentation necessary for design. [14] In addition to the normal laptop components, the Novena motherboard also includes an FPGA , dual Ethernet ports, a three-axis accelerometer, and easily extended hardware. [15] On May 7, 2014 the Novena's crowdfunding campaign reached its goal of $250,000 and went on to raise a total of $722,880 without taking subsequent pre-orders into account. Sean “xobs” Cross is an American living in Singapore. In the past hehas worked on release firmware for Chumby, including the Chumby One and Chumby 8 devices. He is currently building the firmware for Novena, along with the Senoko battery controller board. Most of his work is done with embedded ARM devices. He believes while there are a number of full-featured operating systems for ARM, none has more support than Linux.
