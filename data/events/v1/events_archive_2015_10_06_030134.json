Constraints boost creativity. First, let’s put constraints of no mutable state and no side­-effects on typical imperative code and see where creativity can bring you. Having reinvented referential transparency we proceed with lambda calculus – the theoretic foundation of functional programming. Expressions and recursive function definitions are means of flow control in the land of λ, so these we study next. Having defined several useful recursive functions we suddenly start seeing recurring patterns, which we call higher-­order functions. These prove themselves extremely powerful and you all of a sudden recognize them everywhere. At this point we will have a functional coding dojo just for fun. ","location":"ThoughtWorks office, 87B Amoy Street, Level 3, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/events/225698151/","group_id":12690122,"group_name":"Singapore Scala Programmers","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers","formatted_time":"06 Oct 2015, Tue, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-10-06T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-06T13:30:00.000Z"}]}
