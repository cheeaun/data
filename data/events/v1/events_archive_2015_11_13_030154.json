Protecting Hadoop data at rest with HDFS encryption. Data encryption is a requirement for many business sectors dealing with confidential information, such as finance, healthcare, and government. To meet these requirements, transparent, end-to-end encryption was added to HDFS. Once configured, data read from and written to certain HDFS directories is transparently encrypted and decrypted without requiring any changes to user application code. This encryption is also end-to-end, meaning that data is protected both in-flight and at-rest, and can only be encrypted and decrypted by the client. This improves security since HDFS itself never handles unencrypted data or data encryption keys. During this talk, we will cover the design, implementation, and usage of transparent encryption in HDFS. More details, additional speakers to updated soon.","location":"AWS Offices Singapore, 23 Church Street, Capital Square #10-01, 049481 Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/BigData-Hadoop-SG/events/226576483/","group_id":8165752,"group_name":"BigData.SG & Hadoop.SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/BigData-Hadoop-SG","formatted_time":"13 Nov 2015, Fri, 6:00 pm","start_time":"2015-11-13T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-11-13T12:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1664245593855544","name":"Friday Hacks #104: Code Golf & Semester Afterparty","description":"It’s the last Friday Hacks of the semester, and we’ll be doing something different this time.
