These first mechanical synthesizers produced by Russolo generated sounds of whirrs and buzzes, clangs, scrapes, sirens and mechanically plucked strings. In collaboration with the Italian Cultural Institute and Performa, ArtScience Museum presents two full performances by The Orchestra of Futurist Noise Intoners, an ensemble founded in 2009 by the Italian composer and conductor Luciano Chessa that performs on his replicas of Russolo's earliest Intonarumori orchestra.

In 2012, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to research on genetically induced adult stem cells for “advancing therapy”. This has led to the unprecedented growth in the arena of regenerative medicine using patients’ own cells. As we see a dwindling number of approved small molecule drugs and rising promises of biologics, can we ride on the wave of cell therapy as the next blockbuster or personalised therapeutics? Biotech Connection Singapore brings you a panel of key opinion figures in the Singapore cell therapy community, as we discuss the opportunities and challenges of translating stem cell research into clinical applications.    \n-          Are our technologies ready to develop the ideal candidate for cell-based therapy possessing characteristics such as accessibility, ease of scaling up, long tern safety profile and autologous in nature, etc? \n-          In terms of business models, is Singapore going to stagnate at the level of cord blood banking instead of leading the frontier of cell therapy?  \n-          Japan, Korea and China have emerged as the strong contenders in the development of cell therapy. Is our regulatory framework sufficiently established to administer cell therapy trials locally?  \n-          How do we prevent non-compliant clinical practices which put desperate patients at risks? \n  \nProgramme \n6:30 – 7:00 PM               Registration \n 7:00 – 7:10 PM               BCS & Speaker Introduction   \n7:10 – 8:30 PM               Panel Discussion and Q&A   \n8:30 – 9:30 PM               Networking Reception \n  \nOur Speakers \n  \nProf. James Hui  \nHead & Senior Consultant, Division of Paediatric Orthopaedics \nDirector, Cartilage Repair Program, National University Health System, Singapore \n  \n  \n  \nProf. James Hui specializes in the management of orthopaedic problems in children, as well as general orthopaedics.

This talk will scan through the developer scene both locally, globally, online or on-ground and give examples on where anyone can contribute, get involved and get more information about the vibrant technology scene. What communities can you join easily and learn? Which meetups can you attend and even help to co-organize? How to start contributing to open source? Can we easily share with by writing our own blogs, books or even making podcasts? What are some interesting twitter accounts or blogs to follow? How can we add in short trips to engage with locals while traveling anywhere in the world? We will discuss all these questions and more!

For example, setting up IIS, deployment, coding, framework, etc. ( anyone wants to contribute for speaking, please contact me ). • Windows Universal App , let's make an app for Windows 8.1 , Windows Phone 8.1 and Android . - Punit Ganshani [Microsoft MVP on .NET] • S mart auto complete in WPF . Have you ever wondering what you will get when you type a keyword in a combo box or text box with auto complete? Well, you always do coding for thelist that you may aleady knew,but what if you don't know the list? I will share on some simple codes that can make the auto complete or search text box smarter than just sorting contains what you type. - Riza • How to use Azure SQL Database using .NET the right way.
