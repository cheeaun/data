As a follow up to Sergey's brilliant functional programming talk we will be doing the poker hands kata that he suggested. You can get the instructions from here. All levels are most welcome and we will try to pair up beginners with more experienced coders so if you are a beginner this is a great way to learn.  There is a skeleton project available at https://github.com/SingaporeScalaProgrammers/poker_hands.  It might be a good idea to make sure that you can at least compile and run a project before the meetup as it can take a while to download the necessary dependencies if you haven't got it set up already. Also, don't forget to contribute any of your top Scala tips to https://github.com/SingaporeScalaProgrammers/scalatips  If we get enough together we will read out a few before starting the kata.  Looking forward to seeing you there!","location":"ThoughtWorks office, 87B Amoy Street, Level 3, Singapore","latitude":1.283051,"longitude":103.848541,"rsvp_count":26,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/events/226967141/","group_id":12690122,"group_name":"Singapore Scala Programmers","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers","formatted_time":"03 Dec 2015, Thu, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-12-03T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-12-03T13:30:00.000Z"}]}
