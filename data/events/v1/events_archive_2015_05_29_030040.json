These languages are large and complicated, which makes it difficult to grasp the essence of functional programming. Church's Lambda Calculus is the oldest and simplest possible functional programming language. It has the following syntax: ::= a | b | ... | z ::= | (Î» ) | ( ) In this talk, we will illustrate the principles of functional programming using Church's Lambda Calculus via a series of demos based on http://www.ioccc.org/2012/tromp/hint.html About the speaker: Melvin Zhang is an avid programmer who enjoys minimal programming languages and elegant algorithms. At Cosmiqo International, Melvin is developing its sensor data aggregation and analytics platform.

Just bring in a laptop and you can immediately learn how to code simple dapps, upload information etc on to the Ethereum Blockchain. In order to get started nice and quickly tomorrow could you please download Ethereum's client so that you can take part in the workshop, Software requirements: Getting your development environment setup should be fairly simple for anyone who has designed a web page before - you will need a text editor and a copy of our client. Download the latest stable (master) binary of Alethzero, our C++ client, and install on your chosen operating system. If you experience problems with the stable build then you may wish to switch to the latest cutting edge version, which may ameliorate some of your issues. If you choose instead to build your own then build instructions are on the web page linked. There are tutorials located here dappsforbeginners.wordpress.com if you want to play before the workshop. See you tomorrow! Food and drinks are provided at this event.
