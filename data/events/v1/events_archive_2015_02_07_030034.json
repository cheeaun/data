Forecast is for light winds with a slight chance of rain - suggest bringing an umbrella just in case! See you Saturday! ----- Bring your drones and let's have fun! Open to suggestions on activities / challenges, but here're are some ideas (still figuring out rules to keep it safe for our drones!): 1. Oval course racing, 1 on 1 and/or fleet 2. Obstacle course time trials (fly through hoops etc...) 3. Drone 'basketball' - 1 on 1 fly through the hoop before your opponent to score points Don't forget to bring all your spare batteries, and chargers, and bringing cold beers also encouraged! N.B. This is all 'weather permitting', if the weather looks sketchy, then we'll relocate to somewhere nearby for coffee or something... I'll post an update earlier on in the day if it's a NG. N.B. This is a privately organised event and not a commercial venture. All participants participate at their own risk and liability.
