This time, I'm going to try another theme, inspired and adapted from Agile Conference 2014 . Open Space Theme: Working with Customers This theme focuses on: 1) How to identify and engage your customers - internal users, external clients, product managers, project sponsors etc.. Each of these groups have different needs and building a product without engaging each of them can be disastrous. 2) How to build the “right product”, how to validate and ensure that we are actually delivering value to our customers. Agenda 7:00pm - Food 7:30pm - Generate topics and schedule 8:00pm - Breakout to topic sessions 10:00pm - End We welcome contributions of drinks and snacks! =) What is Open Space? Open Space is a highly collaborative and self-organised meeting where topics are generated on the spot and discussed by the participants through breakout sessions.
