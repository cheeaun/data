The price of Bitcoin may have you down, or greedy to buy more? In any case, join us for the first meetup of 2015. In Japanese, this is a Shinnenkai (Ode to Satoshi), a tradition of welcoming the arrival of the New Year, usually by the drinking of alcohol. We are working on having a regular bi-monthly meetup on Tuesdays at Ice Cold Beer at SMU. This will be the first. Let's show them we can bring a crowd of thirsty Bitcoiners! Hoping to have them ready to take Bitcoin as well! Dave Shin will be giving a presentation on what he's working on in the crypto space. Dave was a co-founder of The Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, and recently moved to Singapore to set up Paywise.org here. Please RSVP so we can get an idea of total numbers. Thanks- see you on Tuesday.

Hope you are excited for the first meetup of the 'Year of Gopher' ( http://twitter.com/davecheney/status/550276404026150912 ) . Here's the line-up for the Meetup: * Customising Your Own Web Framework in Go Jonathan Gomez, Engineer @ Zumata At Zumata we use Go in our main API. We've chosen a mix of using the Go standard library and bite-sized open-source components (i.e. handling routing/middleware/persistence), rather than adopting a fuller web framework, or relying purely on the standard lib. This talk outlines our experiences, and aims to help you get started building and structuring your APIs in Go. * Adventures in IoT with Golang Lakshan Perera & Audrey Lim Sharing our little experiments in trying to power anything and everything with Go. * Pop Quiz (10-20 mins) We are introducing a new segment from this year, so come prepared to write code (bring your laptop or a pen & paper) As usual, there will be pizza.
