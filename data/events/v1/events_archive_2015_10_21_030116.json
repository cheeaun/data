Telling stories through data A journey in data visualization and digital storytelling Technology is changing the way that stories are being presented and told. At the same time, we're drowning in data and the need for clear, concise storytelling is greater than ever. All these data and technologies present opportunities to explore and reinvent how stories are being presented. Data visualization, data journalism, content games; all are aspects of how we can use UX + content/data to shape compelling narratives. We'll look at some data visualization examples and go through the design to answer questions. For example, for the past GE2015 election, which voting district in Singapore was the most politically apathetic? Which districts have the most spolit votes and why? Beyond the recent elections, we'll also look at other data visualizations and digital perspectives and how they relate to data science. Speaker Bio Chi-Loong suffers from an incurable disease called curse of the curious hybrid. He has a background in Computer Science, but somehow wandered into journalism, marketing and public relations. Past lives include mainstream and trade media, in-house and agency PR, energy and social media start-ups like Straits Times, British Telecoms and GolinHarris. The corporate world is not really suited for hybrids so he decided to forge out and co-found V/R (www.vslashr.com), a niche agency that blends art + science to tell stories through technology. \n\n\nDeep learning for stock market prediction It has been shown that news events influence the trends of stock price movements. However, previous work on news-driven stock market prediction rely on shallow features (such as bags-of-words, named entities and noun phrases), which do not capture structured entity-relation information, and hence cannot represent complete and exact events. Recent advances in Open Information Extraction (Open IE) techniques enable the extraction of structured events from web-scale data.  The speaker proposes to adapt Open IE technology for event-based stock price movement prediction, extracting structured events from large-scale public news without manual efforts. Both linear and nonlinear models are employed to empirically investigate the hidden and complex relationships between events and the stock market. Large- scale experiments show that event-based system out-performs bags-of-words-based baselines, and previously reported system strained on S&amp;P 500 stock historical data. The team further use deep learning to improve the representation of event for enhanced generalization, and to capture the influence of long-term and short-term historical events simultaneously. These techniques boost the accuracy of index prediction from 60% to 66%, and significantly enhance the accuracy of individual stock prediction. \n\n\n\nSpeaker Bio Yue Zhang is currently an assistant professor at Singapore University ofTechnology and Design. Before joining SUTD in July 2012, he worked as apostdoctoral research associate in University of Cambridge, UK. Yue Zhang received his DPhil and MSc degrees from University of Oxford, UK, and his BEng degree from Tsinghua University, China. His research interests include natural language processing, machine learning and artificial Intelligence. He has been working on statistical parsing, parsing, text synthesis, machine translation, sentiment analysis and stock market analysis intensively. Yue Zhang serves as the reviewer for top journals such as Computational Linguistics, Transaction of Association of Computational Linguistics and Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. He is also PC member for conferences such as ACL, COLING, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, AAAI and IJCAI. Recently, he was the area chairs of CLING 2014, NAACL 2015 and EMNLP 2015.
