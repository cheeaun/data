This meetup is intended to: • Provide you with time and space to work through the LearnChef.io content on your own machine • Meet and discuss with others on your learning if you would like • Watch a screened Chef &amp; DSC Web recording from Chef's Steven Murawski • Take a look at some Pluralsight content \n\n\nI'll be on hand to talk about DSC if you'd like to talk about that, I'll be going through the Chef content myself and look forward to having some good discussion.","location":"Microsoft Singapore, One Marina Boulevard, Level 22, Meeting Room","latitude":0,"longitude":0,"rsvp_count":32,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/mssgug/events/225252780/","group_id":18429776,"group_name":"Microsoft User Groups (Singapore)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/mssgug","formatted_time":"28 Nov 2015, Sat, 10:00 am","start_time":"2015-11-28T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-11-28T09:00:00.000Z","yes_rsvp_count":32},{"id":"vdkdhlytpblc","name":"3D Scan Your Face Session","description":"Hi!!   We've got another session of face 3D scanning lined up this Saturday at IDA@Labs@ Bugis.
