I'll explain why we have to do that and why we are choosing to experiment the concept of immutable infra. I will also talk about how we found that devOps are the direct link between the product team and our customers and why we want to automate the delivery pipe as much as we can. My view will be from a devOps perspective but also from a CTO perspective , at a higher level. Shout out to ThoughtWorks for providing the venue and food and drinks.
