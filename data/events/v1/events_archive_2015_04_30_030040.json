With this talk I would therefore like to share some reasons that I think doing TDD might help you get things done faster and better. How it all helps me feel more safe when requirements changes and ensuring those pesky bugs stays fixed. This will mostly be a talk of why, for the how I recommend Gabe's excellent intro to Pytest from the last meetup linked above. 2. How I built a SFTP service using Paramiko by Steve 3. 4. \"Python tips / Module of the month\" by …you? -------------- Would you like to speak at this or a future meetups?
