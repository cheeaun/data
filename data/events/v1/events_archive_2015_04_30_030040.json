Getting started with testing using Pytest and Mock - PythonSG Meetup by Gabe Hollombe 2. Developing real time applications in Django with Websockets - PythonSG Meetup by Gerald Goh 3. How to learn and be productive with Python3 in a week - PythonSG Meetup by Chris 4. Three Python tips - PythonSG Meetup by Martin Brochhaus And a link to Bitmazk's Github as mentioned in the video. -------------- Talks 1. \"Why should you do behavior/test driven development\" by Björn Andersson Being a crimson speckled pythonista that dabbles with Ruby I've noticed that the amount of people that do TDD in the Python community is a lot fewer than in the Ruby community. With this talk I would therefore like to share some reasons that I think doing TDD might help you get things done faster and better. How it all helps me feel more safe when requirements changes and ensuring those pesky bugs stays fixed. This will mostly be a talk of why, for the how I recommend Gabe's excellent intro to Pytest from the last meetup linked above. 2. How I built a SFTP service using Paramiko by Steve 3. 4. \"Python tips / Module of the month\" by …you? -------------- Would you like to speak at this or a future meetups? You could share about your technology stack, how you solved a problem, your new library, or your opinions on best practices, so that people can get to know how awesome you are! 5 Python tips is a small segment at the end of meetup where you can share some things that make your Python life easier. A newly discovered core module, a library or some command line tool that makes your life better and/or easier. So don't be shy! Step forward and share your knowledge! For speaking please contact Björn, @gaqzi or <ba@sanitarium.se>, or Victor <icyisamu@gmail.com> See you all soon! -------------- Job Postings Are you looking for Pythonista?

Register on the day. Conference Summary In May 2015, ArtScience Museum will host a conference exploring the legacy of history's most celebrated artist and scientist, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). Most studies of da Vinci focus on a specific area of his activity - art, anatomy, technology, studies on water, on flight, and so on. This conference will offer a different point of view, encouraging an exploration of da Vinci's way of thinking and of the cultural landscape, which nurtured him. It will analyse how his interdisciplinary approach, which we now refer to as “systems thinking” and \"complexity\", remains strikingly resonant for us today, and applied within the fields of art, science, technology, education and foresight. The conference begins with a special edition of ArtScience Museum's monthly performance programme, ArtScience Late (Thursday 7 May), and continues for two full days of discussions on Friday 8 and Saturday 9 May, featuring presentations from within Singapore and around the world, from a range of leading speakers in the fields of history, art, science & technology, education, and futures thinking. It includes keynotes from major names in art history such as Professor Paolo Galluzzi (Italy), as well as dynamic contemporary artists, innovative scientists and technologists, and influential cultural commentators. This conference has been co-convened by Honor Harger and Anna Salaman (ArtScience Museum), and Andrea Nanetti (Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design and Media). Thursday 7 May 2015, 7pm – 10pm ArtScience Late will feature a special performance from, our international ArtScience resident, Maurizio Martinucci (TeZ). The show is free, and there will be performances at 8pm and 9pm. For more, see: https://www.facebook.com/events/628941177236899/ Friday 8 May 2015, 10am – 6.15pm The first full day of the conference presents Leonardo da Vinci and the approach that he took to all of his lines of enquiries. It analyses how da Vinci not only understood the essence of ‘systems thinking’, but how he also applied this to his inventions, ideas and work generally. We ask, was this approach extraordinary for its time? Was da Vinci different from his renowned contemporaries in this way? To address these questions, the key note speaker, Professor Paulo Galluzzi will present an overview of da Vinci’s life, influences, influencers and projects in this context, and Don Alberto Rocca will provide the cultural context of da Vinci’s time and place. We will explore if there was something within the context of da Vinci’s time which encouraged his thinking and ‘systems’ awareness, or was this a one-off – a spike in the linear progression of epistemology? We ask if there are there other examples of interdisciplinary thinking and approaches throughout history. The day will continue with a reflection on the more recent times and the advent of new media – a marriage of two seemingly quite separate, established disciplines: art and technology, moving the dialogue into the 20th century, and beyond.

It will cover how science and technology environments might nurture the \"Leonardos\" of tomorrow and stimulate interdisciplinary working, and look at innovative education and pedagogical methodologies today which will encourage the same. Fittingly, the last session looks to the future. Curated by Forum for the Future, it addresses how complex problems of this time may be solved using multidisciplinary and the ‘systems’, or ‘complexity theory’ approaches. A sub-theme will explore addressing challenges at scale. Timetable and Speakers 10:00am Registration 10.30am Session 4: Systems thinking in science and technology Chair: Honor Harger, Executive Director, ArtScience Museum. This session explores systems thinking within a science and technology context. It will cover how science and technology environments might nurture the \"Leonardos\" of tomorrow. The speakers will discuss how different science and technology environments, from more traditional environments, such as science labs, educational science centres, to informal technology environments such as makerspaces, and co-working spaces, might stimulate interdisciplinary working.

As such, Alex and I are organising a series of tutorials on the top data mining algorithms. The content of the talks will aim to cover a little understanding of the theory, but will mostly focus on examples with R. The 8 - 10 algorithms we aim to cover include: • k-means • SVM • Apriori • Naive Bayes • Random forests and decision/regression trees • EM • kNN • AdaBoost We intend for the sessions to be held on a monthly basis, lasting about an hour or so. The venue will be 237 South Bridge Road. We’ll have to collect SGD 5 a head, but this goes toward the venue and refreshments (not into our pockets =)). We'll collect it at the door on the day itself. The speakers for the talks will be our very own RUGS members. If you are an expert in one of the topics and would like to conduct the session, do let us know! For the first talk, Alex will be speaking about SVM. Here is a short overview of the talk, and a little bit about Alex too About SVM: SVM is nowadays one of the most popular classification algorithms. It is efficient in dealing big data set. It allows us to fit nonlinear classification boundary with kernel methods. Moreover, the combination of penalization and “customized” kernel enable us to introduce prior knowledge into classification. In this R share session, we will quickly go through the theoretical part of SVM, and demonstrate the application with R package “kernlab”. And last but not least, we will show 2 examples to let you feel the power of SVM. About Alex: I am a statistician in HSOR@NHG. I have been studying statistics for 6 years and using R for 6 years. My research areas are statistical learning, computing statistics, data visualization and data science with population health management.
