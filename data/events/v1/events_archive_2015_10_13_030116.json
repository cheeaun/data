So we are looking to build novel and practical applications on the seasonal haze situation that blankets Singapore every year. We are bringing together developers, bloggers, environmental organizations and media associations in an unprecedented civic hack to enhance our media reporting and response to the haze through the use of data. KEY OBJECTIVES Participants in the one-day haze-a-thon, on October 13, will be challenged to develop solutions, tools, widgets or apps that will enhance media reporting and citizen's responses to the haze. Proposed solutions could address some of the following challenges:  ●Forecast weather movements●Deliver objective, trustworthy PSI figures●Send timely alerts to residents●Help citizens to take adequate decisions and actions●Improve public education Please remember to sign up on Eventbrite here hazehack.eventbrite.sg  \n\n\nJOIN US FOR AFTER HACK SOCIAL DRINKS After the Hyper Haze Hack, join us for ONA's monthly social drinks just downstairs at The Bank Bar &amp; Bistro.
