Does the shape of the plate change the taste of the cake?  This August, join us as leading artists and scientists in the fields of psychology, sound art, perception, and multimodal design come together to explore how sound acts as the glue connecting our sensorial experiences and interactions. Guest speakers include luminaries such as interaction designer, Stefania Serafin, crossmodality researcher Charles Spence, composer Joyce Beetuan Koh, filmmaker Daniel Belton, and psycholinguist Suzy Styles. Chairing the event is PerMagnus Lindborg, organizer behind Soundislands Festival 2015 and a celebrated sound artist and researcher in his own right. The event will close with a special performance by CLUBbleu who will showcase their signature sounds of electro-acoustics, deep drones and broken blast beats.\n\nThe event is part of the Soundislands Festival, initiated by PerMagnus Lindborg with support from CLASS and ADM at Nanyang Technological University, the Italian Institute of Culture, and the Arts Council of New Zealand.\n\nSchedule\n\n2.30-2.45: PerMagnus Lindborg\nOpening and welcome address\n\n2.45-3.00pm: Dr Suzy Styles, Assistant Professor, Nanyang Technological University\nLanguage: Spoken, Heard, Connected \n\n3.00-3.15pm: Daniel Belton, Artistic Director, Good Company Arts\nMovement: When One Falls \n\n3.15-3.30pm: Joyce Beetuan Koh, Senior Lecturer and Vice Dean of Interdisciplinary Studies, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts \nStage: Illusions and Involvement\n\n3.30-3.45pm: Charles Spence, Professor, Head of Crossmodal Research Laboratory\nCuisine: Scent.
