As always, the following rules apply:1) Don't switch on your VTx without pre-announcing it to fliers currently in the air and waiting for their confirmation2) Make sure you know your VTx frequency and are able to adjust it3) During racing, if you're not currently racing do not switch on at all, until the current race is complete4) Don't fly beyond your own abilities We're a friendly and encouraging group though, so even if you're a beginner we'll help you to get started. NB - This is a casual meetup and all attendees are responsible for their own safety and liability.","location":"Rhu Cross, Rhu Cross, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/dronesg/events/225698729/","group_id":18318692,"group_name":"Singapore Drone Fun Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/dronesg","formatted_time":"18 Oct 2015, Sun, 4:00 pm","start_time":"2015-10-18T08:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-18T10:00:00.000Z"}]}
