Starting from May, we would try to change to a monthly schedule, We try to arrange the meetup to be at the first Wednesday of each month, since we observe that more RSVP on meetup hosted on Wednesday. Therefore we always welcome speakers willing to share things related to Haskell, no matter it is basic or advanced or lightning talk. Don't hesitate to contact us. For the meetup in May, we would have three haskell talks. First one is Arnaud Bailly share on building startup in haskell. Second one is FPGA synthesis by Dr. Gergő Érdi. We are going to finish with a lightning talk on an alternative description of Haskell packages by Simon Hengel. * Haskell all the way down - building a startup in Haskell Sneak peak of past slide: https://speakerdeck.com/abailly/haskell-all-the-way-down * FPGA synthesis with Kansas Lava * hpack: An alternative format for Haskell packages (lightning talk) # Speakers: Arnaud Bailly: https://github.com/abailly Dr. Gergő Érdi: http://unsafePerform.IO Simon Hengel: http://typeful.net ","location":"Hackerspace.SG, 344B King George's Ave, King George's Building, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/HASKELL-SG/events/221949523/","group_name":"HASKELL.SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/HASKELL-SG","formatted_time":"06 May 2015, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-05-06T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-05-06T14:30:00.000Z"}]}
