The good people of JFDI are so kind to host us for the entire Saturday, provide WiFi, coffee and lunch so you can spend the day learning about WebRTC with the team of the worlds technology leading WebRTC company Temasys. We'll show you around all our recent work and what it can do to bring embedded audio/video and data real-time communication into your app or website. So, if you're a web, iOS or Android developer and you'd like to hack around with WebRTC, come by! The Temasys team will judge the best work in the evening and we'll give out swanky prices to the winners! We'll max out at ~30 people, so be fast! To get you warmed up, here is Thomas' most recent talk about WebRTC and Skylink.

You are probably in the right place. Registration RSVP yes if you can commit that whole afternoon to code and answered yes on the 4 prerequisites below. Four Prerequisites 1. Read the book Working Effectively with Legacy Code or otherwise, read a short article about it. 2. Already understood why writing automated unit tests and Test-Driven Development is beneficial. 3. Have experience working in Java, C# or other similar Object-Oriented programming language 4. Able to attend from 1:00pm to 5:00pm *** Do not need to rsvp if you are just coming to observe during that time. *** Background Have you experienced codes that are hard to understand and is brittle? How do you deal with that more effectively? We're going to spend four solid afternoon hours to practice how to work more effectively with legacy code by having coding dojo with the Trivia Game. This code kata is used in Legacy Code Retreat and you can find the source codes here github.com/jbrains/trivia . At the end, the legacy code should become cleaner and easier to understand. A lot of the methods used will be based on Michael Feathers' Working Effectively with Legacy Code . We will spend most of the time experimenting different strategies and see how it affect the code readability and design. How does it work? • Coding dojo randori • 2 groups of 6-8 people size of different programming language. • at the end of the day, do the Code Retreat Closing Circle: gather everyone together in a circle, then go one by one sharing something about the day What legacy code do we work on? https://github.com/agilesingapore/coding_dojo_legacy_code ","location":"Odd-e Singapore - Goodland Building, 18 Roberts Lane, #05-01","url":"http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Singapore/events/220445204/","group_name":"Agile Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Agile-Singapore","formatted_time":"28 Feb 2015, Sat, 1:00 pm","start_time":"2015-02-28T05:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-02-28T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"220532679","name":"DataScience SG Meetup - Feb (DataSpark & Unilever Challenge)","description":" For our meetup in February, we'll have speakers from DataSpark (Singtel) and the recent Unilever Challenge. 2.00 pm: Networking (BYOR- Bring Your Own Refreshments =) 2.15 pm - 2.45pm: Thomas Holleczek LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=157514153 • Title: Analytics for human mobility • The speaker will talk about his phd work (sensor based snowboarding assistant) and some mobility research he's been working on at Singtel. 2.45pm - 3pm: Break 3.00 pm - 3.40pm: Approaches to solving the Unilever Challenge problem by finalist teams • Praveen Bysani - Demo of solution & insights using rapid miner.
