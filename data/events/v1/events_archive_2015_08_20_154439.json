Clarence Tauro from CouchBase will be traveling to Singapore on that week and will be our guest speaker. We have interviewed Clarence here. Abstract NoSQL databases offer a significant change to how enterprise applications are built, challenging to two-decade hegemony of relational databases. The question people face is whether NoSQL databases are an appropriate choice, either for new projects or to introduce to existing projects. This talk will give a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency and polyglot persistence. It will then dive into Couchbase, which is a high-performance NoSQL distributed database with a flexible data model. Finally it will discuss how to integrate CouchBase with Spring using the Spring Data Couchbase project.  ============================================Note: if you are interested to go for CouchBase training in Singapore, all information is available here:  http://training.couchbase.com/class/for-developers/cd220-developing-couchbase-nosql-applications/singapore-central-singapore/2015a","location":"PayPal office in Suntec, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, 038985 Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/224470403/","group_name":"Singapore Spring User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/singasug","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"224445724","name":"DSSG Aug Meetup - DataRobot","description":"*Please note that RSVP will only start on Sunday (Aug 16), 1230pm.* This month, we are proud to have Xavier from DataRobot to do a deep dive into data modeling.   Synopsis: Xavier will present the solution he and his colleagues from DataRobot developed to win the 3rd prize at the KDDCup 2015. The competition consisted of predicting dropouts of students of XuetangX, a MOOC platform initiated by Tsinghua University in China. Xavier will describe how he converted students log data into usable features for Machine Learning using counts, simple statistics, entropy, factorization and text mining techniques.  Agenda: • 7.00pm - 7.15pm: Networking • 7.15pm - 8.15pm: Xavier: Featurizing log data for predicting dropouts in MOOC @ KDDCup 2015. • 8.15pm - 8.30pm: Closing and Networking. Xavier Conort is the Chief Data Scientist at DataRobot, a venture-backed predictive analytics software company. Xavier has applied Machine Learning to diverse business problems ranging from churn prediction to claims modeling, flight arrival prediction, essay scoring, sales forecasting, and biological response prediction. To sharpen his skills in Machine Learning, Xavier competes on Kaggle and in KDDCups where he won 10 prizes. Before joining DataRobot, Xavier was principal research engineer in I2R and has an extensive experience in the insurance industry as an actuary in France, Brazil, China and Singapore. • Linkedin: https://www.kaggle.com/xavierconort  • Please note that RSVP will only start on Sunday (Aug 16), 1230pm.","location":"#03-04, IDA Labs@NDC 111 Middle Road, National Design Centre, Singapore 188969., IDA Labs@NDC 111 Middle Road, National Design Centre","url":"http://www.meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore/events/224445724/","group_name":"DataScience SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"224693414","name":"JS Beginner Study Group","description":"- The purpose of this study group is for sharing and discussion on JS - We do not host any talks or courses This week, we will carry on with \"You Don't Know JS\"  and after the discussion, we can start working on our own practical projects.  **Please bring your laptops and try to read up on the following material: Scope &amp; Closures - http://bit.ly/1PeOFoc Please try to read Chapter 3, 4 &amp; 5 for the discussion. **Join our chat channel: #milo-dinosaur on Kopi.JS Slack - http://kopijs.herokuapp.com/","location":"Hackerspace.SG, 344B King George's Ave, King George's Building, Singapore","url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/224693414/","group_name":"SingaporeJS","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-JS","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T13:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"1563358550577683","name":"ArtScience Late","description":"[TICKETS SOLD OUT!] \nRyoji Ikeda: Supercodex\nThursday 20 August, 8pm\nArtScience Museum, Level 4\n\nhttp://www.marinabaysands.com/museum/exhibitions-and-events/artscience-late.html  \n\nPREPARE TO BE IMMERSED IN A MULTI-SENSORIAL EXTRAVAGANZA.\n\nArtScience Museum is thrilled to welcome Japan’s leading electronic composer and visual artist, Ryoji Ikeda, to the museum for one night only.\n\nSonic artist, visual artist, and composer in one, Ryoji Ikeda has gained international renown for his striking audiovisual artworks. Ikeda's work is deeply rooted in an ongoing investigation of mathematics and science. He uses stunning, immersive visuals, and a distinctive electronic music style to communicate complex topics about the outer limits of science, in a highly accessible way.  \n\nHis performance for ArtScience Late, as part of the Sound Islands Festival, is supercodex [live set]. It makes the invisible data that permeates our world tangible and perceivable.  The performance showcases how sound can be turned into data and how data can be turned into sound.  supercodex [live set] draws inspirations from the idea of quantum superposition, a key principle of contemporary physics. It investigates how we understand the reality of nature on an atomic scale through mathematical models and quantum mechanics. supercodex [live set] begins subtly, with digital noise, pure tones and bass drones, and gradually builds into an immersive, textured sensory audiovisual experience.\n\nDon’t miss this unique opportunity to see one of the world's most acclaimed experimental performers, in an extraordinary live event that is bound to be an unforgettable experience. \n\nConcept, composition: Ryoji Ikeda\nComputer graphics, programming: Tomonaga Tokuyama\nFor more information please visit: http://www.ryojiikeda.com/archive/concerts/#supercodex_live_set\n\nPart of the Soundislands Festival [Logo] \n\nAbout Ryoji Ikeda\n\nHailing from Japan, and based in France, Ryoji Ikeda focuses on the essential characteristics of sound, light and mathematics. He has gained a reputation as one of the few international artists working convincingly across both visual and sonic media. He elaborately orchestrates sound, visuals, materials, physical phenomena and mathematical notions into immersive live performances and installations.\nHe has performed and exhibited worldwide in the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo, MoMA New York, Tate Modern in London, Ars Electronica Center Linz, Elektra Festival Montreal, Sonar Festival Barcelona, Aichi Triennale Nagoya, Palazzo Grassi Venice, Park Avenue Armory New York, Museo de Arte Bogota, Hamburger Bahnhof Berlin, Sharjah Biennale, Auckland Triennale, MONA Museum Hobart, Telefonica Foundation Madrid, and many other locations.\n\nHe has recently been touring his new performance, superposition, in major venues such as Centre Pompidou in Paris, Barbican Center in London, Kyoto Experiment in Japan, Concertgebouw Brugge and Amsterdam, Metropolitan Museum in New York, Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and Center for the Arts of Performance UCLA in Los Angeles. His large scale light and sound installation, spectra, was recently presented in Hobart, Australia, Sharjah, UAE, and London as part of First World War Centenary Art Commissions.\n\nHis musical recordings and albums +/- (1996), 0°C (1998), matrix (2000), dataplex (2005), test pattern (2008) and supercodex (2013) pioneered a new minimal world of electronic music through his razor-sharp techniques and aesthetics. \n\nHe is the award winner of the Prix Ars Electronica Collide@CERN 2014.  In 2015, he will present solo exhibitions at The Vinyl Factory London, ZKM Karlsruhe and Kumu Museum Tallinn among others.\n\nFor more information: www.ryojiikeda.com","location":"ArtScience Museum","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1563358550577683","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/156726297714355","formatted_time":"20 Aug 2015, Thu, 8:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-20T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-20T14:00:00.000Z"},{"id":1,"name":"Meet Awesome Makers - Eric Wilhelm, Founder of Instructables","description":"Every true blooded Maker needs no introduction to the awesome project sharing site that is Instructables.
