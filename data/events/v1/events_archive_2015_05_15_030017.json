It's not easy. Challenges abound. Thing is, there are tons of knowledge out there about how to manage IT, and even non-IT; best practices, methodologies, frameworks, you name it. Why aren't they being adopted more? I want to clear up some misconceptions and perhaps share some experiences and information as an ex-consultant. \"Best practices\" don't have a good rep. Everyone groans when people talks about best practices. There's a lot of ego involved as well, \"I have this many years of experience, why do I need best practices? I should know!\" Some of this bad rep comes from not understanding about best practices. People need to have a mind-set change about it. Since I've been using, implementing, improving best practices for companies, I'm sharing some of these mistakes the made, what they should be doing instead. Alvin Aloysius Goh has spent over 15 years working for companies in FMCG, Government, Banking and Engineering industries, e.g. IBM, Hewlett Packard. He uses his experience and knowledge to balance theory with practicality to help businesses maximise their IT efficiency, increase operational stability and increase user satisfaction.","location":"Plug-In@Blk71","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/959617460738164","group_name":"Hackers and Painters","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/326203847521210","formatted_time":"15 May 2015, Fri, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2015-05-15T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-05-15T05:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"16909504784","name":"KOEI TECMO Recruitment Talk","description":"Company Background \nKOEI TECMO is one of the world's leading game publishers and developers.
