At Bolton School, Kroto was initially interested in art, geography and gymnastics but he later gravitated towards physics and math with a special interest in chemistry. At the University of Sheffield, he was the art editor of the student magazine, ‘Arrows’ and won several design awards for his book jacket designs.  After earning his PhD in the Spectroscopy of Free Radicals produced by Flash Photolysis, he accepted a postdoctoral position at the Canadian National Research Council in Ottawa and later in Bell Labs in New Jersey. It was a period of great discovery and learning for him where he expanded on his research in spectroscopy and quantum chemistry.  Sir Harold Kroto eventually moved back to Sussex where he was engaged in a research program that he initiated which was designed to detect carbon chains existing in interstellar atmospheres and interstellar gas clouds. This formed the bedrock of the discovery of Carbon-60. Following his 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Kroto has continued conducting fundamental research on the fullerene, examining its basic chemistry and how it has changed the way the scientific world perceives carbon-based materials. Arts and design is also a continual passion for him and he has won numerous accolades with his posters and graphic designs.  Most recently, his design of the Nobel UK Stamp for Chemistry featured at the Royal Academy (London) Summer Exhibition in 2004.\n\nAs part of The Nobel Prize Series Singapore 2015 Conference: The Future of Learning, a unique constellation of Nobel Laureates, world-leading experts and key opinion leaders will be speaking at educational and cultural venues across Singapore. The Nobel Museum exhibition \"The Nobel Prize – Ideas Changing the World\" will be displayed at the ArtScience Museum in Singapore and eminent Sir Harold Kroto will be visiting as part of this bigger programme of Nobel Laureate events.","location":"ArtScience Museum","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/503069643187497","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/156726297714355","formatted_time":"06 Nov 2015, Fri, 3:00 pm","start_time":"2015-11-06T07:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-11-06T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"180677585609461","name":"Friday Hacks #103: Science of the Mind & Q&A with the Director of Engineering at Coursera","description":"Learn about the science of the mind and bring all your questions from engineering to machine learning to the director of engineering at Coursera.\n\nAs usual, pizza will be served before the talks. Hope to see you there!\n\nTopic 1: Science of the mind\nThe science of the mind has undergone a paradigm shift in the past 25 years. One measure of this shift is the number of scientific papers containing the terms \"cognitive neuroscience\" or \"behavioral economics\": in 1990 there were 428 such papers; last year there were more than 20,000. This increase is partly a consequence of an array of new technologies: from single-neuron recording in humans to gene expression mapping to agent-based computational modeling. But the main driver of this increase is a fundamentally new way of viewing human behavior and decision-making. This new approach is mathematical at its core: viewing the brain as an organ whose evolved purpose is to process information and perform computations.\n\nIn this talk I'll give a brief account of the concepts and discoveries at the heart this new view of the mind. I'll then talk about some of our most recent research: rethinking education from first principles. Our effort started when we asked the question: \"What would education look like if it were invented today, taking into account the latest discoveries in the science of the mind?\" Our most recent results involve measuring ways in which students apply focused effort both inside and outside the classroom, the relationship between focused effort and learning, and factors that reliably increase both.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\nShaun Martin is co-founder of Applied Cognitive Science, a company that applies cognitive science, behavioral economics and mathematical modeling to the real world. He has a doctorate in mathematics from Oxford University, and previously held lecturing and research positions at MIT and at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.\n\nTopic 2: Q&A with director of engineering at Coursera\nJiquan Ngiam will talking about engineering at Coursera. How things got started, how we work in engineering, and the challenges we have. It will be an interactive session, bring all your questions from engineering to machine learning to education.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\nJiquan Ngiam was on the founding team of Coursera, an education technology platform that partners with top universities to offer courses online. He currently leads the engineering team, overseeing product, infrastructure, and mobile development. He is invested in creating a future where education is scalable, personalized, and universally accessible. Prior to Coursera, he was pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Stanford where he co-created online machine learning class that was the genesis of Coursera.","location":"SR3, Town Plaza (Level 2), University Town, NUS","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/180677585609461","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/164904410234667","formatted_time":"06 Nov 2015, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2015-11-06T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-11-06T12:30:00.000Z"}]}
