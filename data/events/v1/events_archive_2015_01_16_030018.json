For the first Friday Hacks of the semester, we have Benjamin Tan, Software Engineer at Neo Innovation, Inc., sharing about a new programming language named Elixir, and what interesting things can be done with it. - Talk description from the speaker: \"Lately, I've been consumed with learning and writing about Elixir, functional programming language built on top of the Erlang VM. In this talk, I will give a quick walkthrough of the language. Then, in short examples, I will demonstrate concepts such as concurrency, fault tolerance and distribution – areas where Elixir shines. It will be a fun ride!\" - Speaker profile Benjamin Tan is a software engineer at Neo Innovation, Inc, an author, and a speaker. He has spoken at major conferences such as RubyConf in San Diego, GeekCamp SG and RedDotRubyConf Singapore. He's also an open source contributor working with projects like Rails, Elixir, Spree and the Phoenix Framework. Recently, he has been working on The Little Elixir Guidebook (http://www.exotpbook.com), which will be published in the near future. Some of his writings can be found at http://www.sitepoint.com/author/btan/.
