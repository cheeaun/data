He is a storyteller, weaving together the knowledge that science uncovers about our universe and the technicalities of visualisation to create immersive experiences. He is also heading up the development of a 3D atlas called The Digital Universe. Sit tight as he takes us on a trip round our universe!\n\nAmongst many things that nourish him, Aaron is poet inspired by the solitude and beauty he finds in nature. He will be reading some of his poems, as well as sharing about his involvement in an anthology of local poetry titled From Walden to Woodlands.","location":"344B King George's Rd, 208576","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1187628311253992","group_name":"HackerspaceSG Awesome Talks","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/1478420759137175","formatted_time":"19 Aug 2015, Wed, 8:00 pm","start_time":"2015-08-19T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-19T14:00:00.000Z"}]}
