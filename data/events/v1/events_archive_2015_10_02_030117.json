He'll be covering the SoC Printing system as well as an introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy.\n\nAs always, free pizza is served before the talk. See you there!\n\nTalk 1: NUS SoC Print (Software talk)\nFind out how the NUS SOC Print apps work behind the scenes. Kheng Meng is also looking for developers to take over these projects.\n\nTalk 2: Introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) (Hybrid hardware/software talk)\nBLE is a new and emerging wireless communication standard that was only ratified in 2010. Designed primarily to save power, it is not backward-compatible with the conventional Bluetooth we are all familiar with. Find out how to harness this technology for your hardware projects with live demos and coding examples involving the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Android and iOS.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\nKheng Meng is a recent Computer Science graduate from NUS SoC. He developed both the Android and iOS versions of the NUS SoC Print apps that are still in use today. He used to work at a hardware startup Innova Technology which makes Bluetooth anti-loss devices. After graduating, he is now a hardware developer at Algo Access, a med-tech startup providing solutions for optometrists.","location":"SR3, Town Plaza, UTown","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1655751784694619","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/164904410234667","formatted_time":"02 Oct 2015, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2015-10-02T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-02T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"225550952","name":"10月の飲み会","description":"こんにちは、10月の飲み会を２日金曜日に開催したいと思います。場所は人数が揃い次第決定しますが、リクエストも歓迎です！ 皆さんのご参加をお待ちしております。","location":"川味人家 (Chuan Wei Ren Jia), 17 Mosque Street Singapore 059497 6220 5766","url":"http://www.meetup.com/Japanese-Engineers-in-Singapore/events/225550952/","group_id":14929942,"group_name":"シンガポール日本人エンジニアの会","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Japanese-Engineers-in-Singapore","formatted_time":"02 Oct 2015, Fri, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-10-02T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-02T13:00:00.000Z"}]}
