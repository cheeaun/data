I will also delve a little into automatic differentiation, which has become increasingly useful given the more complicated models being built. Shawn is currently a research assistant in NUS with the speech recognition group. Previously, he worked as a data janitor for Semantics3. EDITOR's NOTE: Shawn Tan will possibly be one of the core contributors who will be responsible for ending human race and inciting the rise of the machines.
