In 2012, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to research on genetically induced adult stem cells for “advancing therapy”. This has led to the unprecedented growth in the arena of regenerative medicine using patients’ own cells. As we see a dwindling number of approved small molecule drugs and rising promises of biologics, can we ride on the wave of cell therapy as the next blockbuster or personalised therapeutics? Biotech Connection Singapore brings you a panel of key opinion figures in the Singapore cell therapy community, as we discuss the opportunities and challenges of translating stem cell research into clinical applications.    \n-          Are our technologies ready to develop the ideal candidate for cell-based therapy possessing characteristics such as accessibility, ease of scaling up, long tern safety profile and autologous in nature, etc? \n-          In terms of business models, is Singapore going to stagnate at the level of cord blood banking instead of leading the frontier of cell therapy?  \n-          Japan, Korea and China have emerged as the strong contenders in the development of cell therapy. Is our regulatory framework sufficiently established to administer cell therapy trials locally?  \n-          How do we prevent non-compliant clinical practices which put desperate patients at risks? \n  \nProgramme \n6:30 – 7:00 PM               Registration \n 7:00 – 7:10 PM               BCS & Speaker Introduction   \n7:10 – 8:30 PM               Panel Discussion and Q&A   \n8:30 – 9:30 PM               Networking Reception \n  \nOur Speakers \n  \nProf. James Hui  \nHead & Senior Consultant, Division of Paediatric Orthopaedics \nDirector, Cartilage Repair Program, National University Health System, Singapore \n  \n  \n  \nProf. James Hui specializes in the management of orthopaedic problems in children, as well as general orthopaedics. His special areas of interest are the care, rehabilitation and surgical treatment of musculoskeletal problems occurring in infants and children, such as hip dysplasia and dislocation, foot deformities, spinal deformities, limb length discrepancies and neuromuscular disorders such as Cerebral Palsy, Spina Bifida and Muscular Dystrophy. Prof. Hui completed his medical degree at the National University of Singapore. He subsequently completed his surgical and orthopaedic training at the National University Hospital, Singapore. He is a fellowship-trained paediatric orthopaedic surgeon, having spent a year in Australia on a paediatric orthopaedic fellowship. Prof Hui is actively involved in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching at NUS.

Industries have been collecting massive amounts of data for years, but it’s been a challenge to analyze this data so that it can lead to actionable items. - M2M: integral step to IoT: One of the ways to see how IoT is becoming a reality is by looking at machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies. M2M refers to machines communicating directly to other equipment without any human intervention, usually through real-time controllers and HMIs. M2M is also an integral step in the development of IoT. - Leveraging existing technologies for interoperability - Tangible results - Benefits from the cloud Benefits of Internet of things • Tracking behavior for real-time marketing; • Enhanced situational awareness; • Sensor-driven decision analytics; • Process optimization; • Optimized resource consumption; and • Instantaneous control and response in complex autonomous systems. • Ubiquitous networks • Connected computing • Ubiquitous sensors • Intelligence at the periphery of the network • Analytics-as-a-Service • Marketing automation • Supply Chain Analytics Audience for the Conference 2014 (Not limited to) - Start-Up in IoT and M2M, and have any product to showcase or any idea to share. - Venture Capitalist, and want to support IoT Start-Ups. - Professional, and works in the area of IoT and M2M - Researcher and want to see latest happening in the area of IoT. - Student and want to enhance your knowledge.
