Join us to pick up a new skill. Rails Girls meetup is an avenue to introduce women to the wonderful language of Ruby and the awesome framework, Ruby on Rails. Learning how to program might seem daunting (it really isn't) but don't worry, we are here to help you along. Instead of a fixed curriculum delivered classroom-style, Rails Girls meetup gives you the flexibility to choose what you want to do. There will be coaches around to answer any problems you have. If you have no idea where to start, we'll guide you through that too! (And yes, everything is hands-on.) Here are some suggestions of what you can choose to do: 1. Install Rails in your computer 2. Continue with your work on the Rails Girls app and perhaps follow some of the additional guides on http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/ , 3. Do the RailsBridge curriculum at http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/ 4. Work on your own project/learning material Please choose one of the options above when you RVSP. ---------- FAQs ---------- I haven't attended any previous Rails Girls events. Can I still join in this one? Absolutely! We can help you start with the Rails Girls app if you did not attend the last workshop. What should I bring? A working laptop and power supply. Is this free? Yes! But we are not providing any food/coffee. Can I come if I'm not a woman? Rails Girls is designed for women and anyone who self-identifies as a woman.
