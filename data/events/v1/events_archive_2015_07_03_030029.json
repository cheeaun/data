However, strategy games and other real-life cases often involve wide-open spaces without well-defined graphs, how does one construct shortest paths between arbitrary points in a space? We give an overview of the most effective algorithms for generating realistic paths using a grid-based approximation of open spaces. Oh Shunhao is a Computer Science and Mathematics student at NUS. He enjoys mathematical problems and algorithms, and loves sharing about them with like-minded people. He also makes games in his spare time. He is currently working with Health Visuals to produce a game for the app store. His current research work involves working on finding fast any-angle pathfinding algorithms for use in games, as well as developing cool visualisations for them.","location":"Plug-In@Blk71","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1651188141762043","group_name":"Hackers and Painters","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/326203847521210","formatted_time":"03 Jul 2015, Fri, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2015-07-03T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-07-03T05:00:00.000Z"}]}
