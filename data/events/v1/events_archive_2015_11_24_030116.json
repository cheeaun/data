This week we'll be covering the chapters on Audacity and Scalable Web Architecture and Distributed Systems. At the end of each week's meetup we will take a vote to select ~two chapters from any of the three AOSA Volumes available. If there's a particular chapter you want us to cover, attend the next meetup and cast your vote!  \"If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your more experienced colleagues think, these books are the place to start. If you are an intermediate or senior developer, and want to see how your peers have solved hard design problems, these books can help you too.\" How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues!

My vision is that the expert users in our group could come forward and share some tips and tricks that they have figured out after using dplyr for some time. It would be sort of an open-mic session. As such, it will not be a tutorial on dplyr; but a session to find out and share solutions with others.  If you have some expertise, please get in touch with me to let me what you would be interested to share, and I can arrange a schedule. If each person just talks for 5-10 minutes with a short example, it would be wonderful. For my part, I propose to talk about the following: 1. using dplyr verbs within other functions. (use of the standard evaluation versions of filter, select, etc.) 2. window functions with dplyr. (Date is fixed for Nov 24th) \n\n\nIn addition, this meetup will be sponsored by O'Reilly, who are organising a Big Data Conference in Singapore from Dec 1 to 3rd: http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/big-data-conference-sg-2015 We have some free swag to give away from O'Reilly, and if you wish to register for the conference, they are offering a 20% discount to our users with discount code UGRUGS.
