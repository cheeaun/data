In a mash up of unpredictable drumming, piano tapping, bass droning, erratic voice-works combined with everyday sounds, anGie together with Ian Woo, Aya Sekine and Wu Jun Han reinterpret emotions and ideas that spoken words fail to evoke. Where words and emotions share no common ground, this immense audio-visual experience will trigger your senses through the orchestra of sounds, actions and imagery. Get ready to open your hearts and minds at this live performance not to be missed.\n\nIn partnership with the NTU CCA Singapore Residencies Programme.","location":"ArtScience Museum","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/606144846190288","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/156726297714355","formatted_time":"08 Oct 2015, Thu, 8:00 pm","start_time":"2015-10-08T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-08T14:00:00.000Z"}]}
