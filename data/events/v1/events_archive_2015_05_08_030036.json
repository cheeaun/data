Register on the day. On 8 and 9 May 2015, ArtScience Museum will host a conference exploring the legacy of history's most celebrated artist and scientist, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). This conference will explore da Vinci's way of thinking and the cultural landscape which nurtured him. It will analyse how his interdisciplinary approach, which we now refer to as “systems thinking” and \"complexity\", remains resonant for us today, and if and how it can be applied within the fields of art, science, technology, education and futures thinking. The conference has been co-convened by Honor Harger and Anna Salaman (ArtScience Museum), and Andrea Nanetti (Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design and Media). Thursday 7 May 2015, 7pm – 10pm ArtScience Late will feature a special performance from, our international ArtScience resident, Maurizio Martinucci (TeZ). The show is free, and there will be performances at 8pm and 9pm. For more, see: https://www.facebook.com/events/628941177236899/ Friday 8 May 2015, 10am – 6pm The first full day of the conference presents Leonardo da Vinci and the approach that he took to all of his lines of enquiries. It analyses how da Vinci not only understood the essence of ‘systems thinking’, but how he also applied this to his inventions, ideas and work generally. We will explore if there was something within the context of da Vinci’s time which encouraged his thinking and ‘systems’ awareness, or if his approach was a one-off. We will ask if there are there other examples of interdisciplinary thinking and approaches throughout history. The day will continue with a reflection on the more recent times and the advent of new media – a marriage of two seemingly quite separate, established disciplines: art and technology, moving the dialogue into the 20th century, and beyond. Friday 8 May 2015 Programme 10:00am Registration 10:15am Welcome remarks by Conference Chairs Honor Harger and Andrea Nanetti 10:30am Session 1: Keynote on Leonardo da Vinci’s approach to systems thinking Chair: Don Alberto Rocca, Director of Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Milan, Italy Speaker Professor Paolo Galluzzi Director, Institute and Museum of History of Science, Florence (Italy), Chair of the Advisory Boards of the National Edition of Leonardo da Vinci’s Manuscripts and Drawings and of the Updates to the National Edition of Galileo Galilei’s Work 11:30am Conversation and Q&A between Don Rocca and Professor Galluzzi on the educational and cultural context in the time of Leonardo. 12pm Lunch break 1pm Session 2: Historical applications of systems thinking Chair: David Harvey, Senior Vice-President of Exhibitions, American Museum of Natural History Speakers: Gunalan Nadarajan, Dean of Stamps School of Art and Design, University of Michigan, speaking along the lines of his paper Automation and Robotics in Muslim Heritage: The Cultural Roots of al-Jazari's Mechanical Systems Gregory Clancey, Associate Professor, Department of History, National University of Singapore, who will critically address the idea of systems, and its relation to Leonardo, from the viewpoint of an historian of technology. Margaret Tan, Fellow and Director of Programmes, Tembusu College, National University of Singapore, who will be contemplating if Singapore has the cultural landscape to nurture “Leonardos” of tomorrow. 2:30pm Tea break 3pm Session 3: Systems thinking in art Chair: Vibeke Sorensen, Chair, NTU School of Art, Design and Media, Singapore Speakers: Luciano Chessa, Composer, performer, musicologist - speaking to his paper, ‘L’Arte dei ‘Romori’: Leonardine Devotion in Luigi Russolo’s Oeuvre Ruben de la Nuez, Lecturer at School of Art, Design and Media, NTU – speaking on New Media Art: Leonardo da Vinci and the Equation of Art and Technology Isabelle Desjeux, Artist and scientist, based in Singapore, with a scientific background background in molecular biology. 5pm Closing remarks by Honor Harger and Andrea Nanetti 5:15pm Optional Tour of Da Vinci: Shaping the Future 6:15pm End of proceedings Saturday 9 May 2015 The whistle-stop tour through key ‘systems thinkers’ in history from the previous day continues with a day exploring contemporary ‘systems approaches’, specifically addressing the areas. It will cover how science and technology environments might nurture the \"Leonardos\" of tomorrow and stimulate interdisciplinary working, and look at innovative education and pedagogical methodologies today which will encourage the same. Fittingly, the last session looks to the future. Curated by Forum for the Future, it addresses how complex problems of this time may be solved using multidisciplinary and the ‘systems’, or ‘complexity theory’ approaches. A sub-theme will explore addressing challenges at scale.

To achieve that, several pieces must fall in place - Distributed scalable operations, pluggable consumable services, cross domain development and standards. The recent adoption of distributed technologies like \"cloud\" technologies (e.g. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), allows startups to compete at the same level as established businesses. Various \"cloud services\" cutting across horizontal domains allows developers to quickly pick and choose reusable components whilst letting them concentrate on the key value proposition of the application. Lastly, unifying everything together with standardised communication between languages and cross platforms allows for growth and flexibility between multi-discipline technologies. In this talk, we will discuss some of the industry trends happening in the near future and show you what is possible today, where applications can be churned out in less than a few months. Specifically, we will take a look at IBM Bluemix, and how it is realising this vision. Various other major industry players have also already started on this revolution towards \"The Age of Software Development Industrialisation\". Justin Lee has been a developer since young, dabbling in everything from C++ to C#, from web development to mobile development. He’s also an active contributor to the technical community, organising community-led events like GeekcampSG and FOSSASIA. Justin Lee is currently working at the IBM Cloud Ecosystem as the Developer Relations guy.","location":"Plug-In@Blk71","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/811921345595792","group_name":"Hackers and Painters","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/326203847521210","formatted_time":"08 May 2015, Fri, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2015-05-08T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-05-08T05:00:00.000Z"}]}
