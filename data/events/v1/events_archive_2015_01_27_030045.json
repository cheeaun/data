The value of getting your hands dirty and especially learning from mistakes is often overlooked. The presentation that you see is often the result of many rounds of scrubbing. The speaker will share some of the common mistakes that he has observed and provide a glimpse of the working drafts before they were scrubbed and polished. He will also talk about the critical success factors that will make or break Analytics implementation. 8:30 pm: Closing and networking. More details on the talk will be updated. Stay tuned to our meetup page.
