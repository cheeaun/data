We welcome specifically commercial outlets, outsourcing companies, digital agencies, startups and freelancers that want to understand the technology better and get to know how it can help them creating better experiences in the future and stand out of the competition by being able to embed real-time audio/video communication and low-latency data exchange into apps and websites. Nontheless, everybody is welcome. App and web developers are encouraged to bring their laptop and any other phone/tablet/smartwatch that they'd like to outfit or get to use with WebRTC.
