Omer will be introducing what monads are and how you can use them to build parsers, while Richard will give an overview about his FYP that lets you parse and evaluate C code inline in vim.\n\nFree pizza is served before the talks. \n\n# Monadic Parsers\n\nIn this talk, we’ll learn about how to write a programming language parser using a functional programming construct called monads.\n\nIt’ll be broken down into three steps:\n\n1) Writing some simple functions to parse chars, numbers etc\n2) Combining these simple parsers to make more complex parsers using higher order functions (bind)\n3) Oh wow, we discovered monads!\n\nAnalogies from other languages will also be given to make the concept independent from Haskell.\n\nThe talk will be based off this paper: http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/courses/3015/parser_pearl.pdf\n\n## Speaker profile\nOmer is an NUS Hackers alumnus, currently working as an iOS Software Engineer at Garena. He also moonlights as a Haskell proselytizer, and is a little obsessed with writing useless, toy compilers.\n\n# Writing Programming Language Applications: C Worksheet Instrumentor\n\nMy FYP has been described as “pretty cool”, “more useful than my FYP”, and “the best thing to ever happen to C”. - A C ‘worksheet’ program providing live-coding features that are becoming more common thanks to editors such as the LightTable (which gained 300K in its KickStarter). See https://github.com/rgoulter/c-worksheet.vim\n\nIn this presentation, I’ll give a sketch as to how to write programs which take in other programs as input, and how these outline how these techniques were applied to write the C worksheet tool.\n\n## Speaker Profile\nRichard is a recent graduate of NUS’ School of Computing, (not as an exchange student). When he was in his first year as an undergrad he grew such an impressive beard that when he shaved it off none of his friends recognised him even though he was the only angmoh in most of his classes.\n\nOur Sponsors\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center and the Infocomm Development Authority.\n\nIf you are looking to turn your ideas into a startup and would love some business support, feel free to get in touch with Agustiadi from NUS Enterprise: agustiadi@nus.edu.sg","location":"SR3, Town Plaza, University Town","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/525850107570346","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/164904410234667","formatted_time":"09 Oct 2015, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2015-10-09T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-09T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"934929626556562","name":"TGIFHacks #39 - PayPal presents PCB Design w KiCAD","description":"Welcome back from the recess week!

But what happens if your app gets popular and it can't handle the load? So, it's a good idea to look at the performance of your app from the start. But, you shouldn’t spend too much time on that. That's where we are going to help you:  * Free access to BulletProof Meteor - Learn what you need to know about Meteor and Performance. (You can complete the basic section in less than 3 hours, then continue as you need) * Free access to Meteor Explained - It's a good idea to learn what's really going inside Meteor. * Full access to Kadira APM. (Load test your app before submitting it - Kadira will help you) Meteor Toys Meteor Toys will be offering free access to their development tools during the hackathon. They will award free licenses to the winning teams of \"Top Five Overall Submissions\", and to three teams they select for \"Most Interesting Use of ToyKit,\" the SDK for building your own Meteor Toys.

We are bringing together developers, bloggers, environmental organizations and media associations in an unprecedented civic hack to enhance our media reporting and response to the haze through the use of data. KEY OBJECTIVES Participants in the one-day haze-a-thon, on October 13, will be challenged to develop solutions, tools, widgets or apps that will enhance media reporting and citizen's responses to the haze. Proposed solutions could address some of the following challenges:  ●Forecast weather movements●Deliver objective, trustworthy PSI figures●Send timely alerts to residents●Help citizens to take adequate decisions and actions●Improve public education Please remember to sign up on Eventbrite here hazehack.eventbrite.sg  \n\n\nJOIN US FOR AFTER HACK SOCIAL DRINKS After the Hyper Haze Hack, join us for ONA's monthly social drinks just downstairs at The Bank Bar &amp; Bistro.

Here is a short synopsis of the session (there will be a hands-on portion so do bring along your laptops with the pre-req packages). And yes, there will be food. Synopsis:With the growing volume of digitized spatial information available, knowledge of spatial visualization and analysis will be extremely useful skills to have for a data scientist. In this session, we will share some basic spatial visualization and analysis using R based on some of the work we do. The focus will be on the use of Leaflet (for R), one of the powerful libraries for interactive visualization of spatial data. We will also briefly mention a few useful libraries for spatial analysis, and provide a few examples related to the work we do.To make the hands-on session smoother, you may wish to install the following R libraries, as well as the following data set: • Leaflet: devtools::install_github(\"rstudio/leaflet\") • rgdal (CRAN) • rgeos (CRAN) • Dengue data (select the SHP icon): http://data.gov.sg/Metadata/OneMapMetadata.aspx?id=DENGUE_CLUSTER&amp;mid=209760&amp;t=SPATIAL Speaker Bio:Chong Jie (CJ) joined the Nielsen Data Science Singapore Innovation group at the end of last year.
