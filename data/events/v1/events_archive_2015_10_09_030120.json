Omer will be introducing what monads are and how you can use them to build parsers, while Richard will give an overview about his FYP that lets you parse and evaluate C code inline in vim.\n\nFree pizza is served before the talks. \n\n# Monadic Parsers\n\nIn this talk, we’ll learn about how to write a programming language parser using a functional programming construct called monads.\n\nIt’ll be broken down into three steps:\n\n1) Writing some simple functions to parse chars, numbers etc\n2) Combining these simple parsers to make more complex parsers using higher order functions (bind)\n3) Oh wow, we discovered monads!\n\nAnalogies from other languages will also be given to make the concept independent from Haskell.\n\nThe talk will be based off this paper: http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/courses/3015/parser_pearl.pdf\n\n## Speaker profile\nOmer is an NUS Hackers alumnus, currently working as an iOS Software Engineer at Garena. He also moonlights as a Haskell proselytizer, and is a little obsessed with writing useless, toy compilers.\n\n# Writing Programming Language Applications: C Worksheet Instrumentor\n\nMy FYP has been described as “pretty cool”, “more useful than my FYP”, and “the best thing to ever happen to C”. - A C ‘worksheet’ program providing live-coding features that are becoming more common thanks to editors such as the LightTable (which gained 300K in its KickStarter). See https://github.com/rgoulter/c-worksheet.vim\n\nIn this presentation, I’ll give a sketch as to how to write programs which take in other programs as input, and how these outline how these techniques were applied to write the C worksheet tool.\n\n## Speaker Profile\nRichard is a recent graduate of NUS’ School of Computing, (not as an exchange student). When he was in his first year as an undergrad he grew such an impressive beard that when he shaved it off none of his friends recognised him even though he was the only angmoh in most of his classes.\n\nOur Sponsors\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center and the Infocomm Development Authority.\n\nIf you are looking to turn your ideas into a startup and would love some business support, feel free to get in touch with Agustiadi from NUS Enterprise: agustiadi@nus.edu.sg","location":"SR3, Town Plaza, University Town","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/525850107570346","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/164904410234667","formatted_time":"09 Oct 2015, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2015-10-09T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-09T12:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"934929626556562","name":"TGIFHacks #39 - PayPal presents PCB Design w KiCAD","description":"Welcome back from the recess week! Hope you guys have had plenty of rest! \n\nThis week, to curb your school blues, we are gonna have a guest speaker, a PayPal employee come down to give a talk on PCB Design using the program KiCAD! PCB is printed circuit board, and is a board that supports electronic components. \n\nPlease download KiCAD here for the workshop! http://kicad-pcb.org/  You can visit the website to learn more about the program too!\n\nPayPal is an international e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet.\n\nThe speaker for the talk will be Mr. Shipeng Xu. Mr. Shipeng is a geek who loves programming and hardware design. In his free time he contributes to open source software/hardware projects frequently. He received his Masters' degree in Embedded Systems from NTU School of Computer Engineering in 2014. He is currently working in PayPal as a software Engineer.\n\nDo come down and learn more about PayPal!\n\nREFRESHMENTS PROVIDED WOOHOO!\n\nSee ya there!","location":"The Nest Theatre @ Innovation Centre","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/934929626556562","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/219467331408976","formatted_time":"09 Oct 2015, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2015-10-09T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-10-09T12:30:00.000Z"}]}
