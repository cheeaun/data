There are absolutely no fees. Just come with an open mind and willingness to share and learn Agenda:  Introduction &amp; Networking : 15 mins News Bytes : 15 mins Understanding the Microsoft Office 2013 Protected-View Sandbox (45 mins) by Yong Chuan. Automotive Networks and Security: Apples and Oranges ? (45 mins) by Philipp Mundhenk.  Abstract of the talk(s): 1. News BytesIt will cover the latest news on information security that were in headlines in last month. 2. Understanding the Microsoft Office 2013 Protected-View Sandbox by Yong Chuan KohSandboxing is a popular modern technique used by vendors to minimize the damages that attackers might inflict on a compromised system by restricting the application’s trust boundaries. Sandboxing raises the bar for exploitation because the compromised application is now “contained”, and typically need at least another vulnerability to escape the sandbox container to achieve the same level of system compromise. As a testament of its effectiveness, popular applications that have adopted sandboxing technique include Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Adobe Reader. Microsoft Office is no exception; its sandbox is implemented as the Protected-View feature since Office 2010. At present, there are many excellent sandbox researches for Chrome, Internet Explorer Enhanced Protected Mode and Adobe Reader. However there is no similar research for the Microsoft Office Protected-View sandbox yet.This talk aims to bridge this gap. The first part of this talk will sketch the Protected-View sandbox internals by discussing about its architecture, its initialization sequence and the system resource restrictions. The second part will discuss the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism, including the mode of communication, undocumented objects involved, format of IPC messages and the semantics of selected IPC messages. 3. Automotive Networks and Security: Apples and Oranges ?In recent weeks, the media was full of news on car hacking and the insecurities in car computer systems. The described scenarios are reminiscent of attacks on computers and computer networks. Why is that? Are cars really insecure? And why have existing security measures not been applied in cars? \n\n\nThis talk will give a short introduction into the world of computerized cars and give lots of examples for security in car networks. How do car networks look like? Where are differences and similarities to computer networks? Where does security come in?The talk will also touch on a few solutions for the challenges in car security, including some of the solutions proposed by the speaker and his team. Speaker(s) Bio:Yong Chuan is a security researcher in the MWR Labs. He mainly likes to find vulnerabilities and exploit them. Philipp Mundhenk received a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering (Network and Software Engineering) from the University of Cooperative Education Baden-Württemberg Lörrach (Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg Lörrach, DHBW) and the National University of Singapore (NUS) and a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours from the Open University London, both in 2010. In 2012 he earned his Master’s Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Technische Universität München (TUM) and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Since 2012, Philipp has been working as Research Associate at TUM CREATE and pursuing a PhD from TUM. His current research interests are centered around security for automotive networks, with a special focus on authentication protocols and verification tools for secure automotive architectures.Speaker’s full CV is available at: https://www.mundhenk.org/about Directions &amp; Venue Map : Map: Please see the meetup map or follow below street view map. https://www.google.com/maps/@1.280919,103.847042,3a,75y,317.56h,95.79t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sVb_jjHjK7OEtOoaHIfwSpQ!2e0?hl=en Streetdirectory: http://www.streetdirectory.com/sg/car-park-amoy-street-a0006/30317_1.html Landmark: Its opposite to Car Park Via MRT: ThoughtWorks(TW) office is 3 mins away from Telok Ayer MRT (DT, purple line) .
