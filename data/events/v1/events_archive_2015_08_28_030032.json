Behind the hype of consumer “selfie” drones lies a vast number of interesting commercial applications, where drones become an enabler for enterprises to gain new aerial perspectives of their facilities and estates, to make intelligent decisions incorporating this additional dimension of data.\n\nIn this presentation, we will survey a number of such applications, reveal some of the behind-the-scene processes and technology platforms, and put on our thinking hats to design a solution for a hypothetical business need. We will also walk through some of the basics and upcoming technical challenges that the industry is looking for a better solution to, including both better hardware (mechanical design, sensors, network), and software (automation, geo-based systems, computer vision, and data analytics).\n\nFree pizza is served before the talks. \n\nSpeaker profile\n\nOng Jiin Joo is the CTO and co-founder of Garuda Robotics. One of his major focus is this idea of “Cloud Robotics”, where robots deployed into the real world are orchestrated in the cloud, leveraging ample compute resource in the cloud to make better use of ubiquitous environment data. Jiin Joo’s earliest career started in Amazon.com’s web development teams. In the years prior to starting up, he worked with SCS, IDA and Singtel to spearhead the test-bedding of new technologies and help enterprise customers adopt these new technologies, which includes fibre connectivity, business continuity, procurement exchanges, SaaS web apps, and enterprise mobility.\n\nGaruda Robotics is a leading drone solutions provider based in Singapore. Operating across Southeast Asia in the agriculture, building management, and security industries, we generate actionable insights for our clients by combining drone aerial data with advanced analytics.\n\nOur Sponsors\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center and the Infocomm Development Authority.\n\nIf you are looking to turn your ideas into a startup and would love some business support, feel free to get in touch with Agustiadi from NUS Enterprise: agustiadi@nus.edu.sg","location":"Seminar Room 2, School of Computing, 13 Computing Drive","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1618580021755297","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/164904410234667","formatted_time":"28 Aug 2015, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2015-08-28T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-08-28T13:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"1384916035148874","name":"TGIFHacks #35 - Intel Invent 50 Competition","description":"Welcome to the very first TGIFHacks session of our new academic year!
