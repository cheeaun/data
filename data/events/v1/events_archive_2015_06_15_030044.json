What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss. ----------------- Original Meetup : http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love Papers Repo : https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love Code of Conduct : https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md","location":"HackerspaceSG","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/463057767192412","group_name":"Papers We Love Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/1535170340032623","formatted_time":"15 Jun 2015, Mon, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-06-15T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-06-15T13:30:00.000Z"}]}
