Behind the hype of consumer “selfie” drones lies a vast number of interesting commercial applications, where drones become an enabler for enterprises to gain new aerial perspectives of their facilities and estates, to make intelligent decisions incorporating this additional dimension of data.\n\nIn this presentation, we will survey a number of such applications, reveal some of the behind-the-scene processes and technology platforms, and put on our thinking hats to design a solution for a hypothetical business need. We will also walk through some of the basics and upcoming technical challenges that the industry is looking for a better solution to, including both better hardware (mechanical design, sensors, network), and software (automation, geo-based systems, computer vision, and data analytics).\n\nFree pizza is served before the talks. \n\nSpeaker profile\n\nOng Jiin Joo is the CTO and co-founder of Garuda Robotics. One of his major focus is this idea of “Cloud Robotics”, where robots deployed into the real world are orchestrated in the cloud, leveraging ample compute resource in the cloud to make better use of ubiquitous environment data.
