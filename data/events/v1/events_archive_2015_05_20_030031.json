A*STAR: Alex Chia Synopsis of talk: With the rapid growth in the usage of social networks worldwide, uploading and sharing of user-generated content has become increasingly prevalent. In particular, users are increasingly sharing visual content, often accompanied with limited amount of text. We believe, as social media moves in a more visual direction, monitoring & advertising technologies needs to be more visual. In this talk, we present our technologies which leverage on this new source of data to monitor and track events as well as to profile social media users. Bio: Alex Chia is the Head of Social Media and Internet Vision Analytics Lab and concurrently the Assistant Director of Visual Intelligence Analytics Center of the Institute for Infocomm Research. Dr. Chia was awarded the Tan Sri Dr. Tan Chin Tuan Scholarship in 2004 and the A*STAR Graduate Scholarship in 2006. He was awarded the Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors’ Merit Award and Silver Award in 2009 and 2012 respectively. His research interests include computer vision, image processing and machine learning.

Go up to Level 1. Exit from the doors besides Starbucks. 2. Turn left and walk along the main road. You'll see a big grey building ahead with 'Fusionopolis Two' and 'Kinexis' written somewhere. 3. Keep walking. After the grey building, you'll see a white one with 'Solaris' written on top. 4. The entrance is on the left side. The meetup is on Level 4 of the North Tower (head to the security desk on Level 1 first). See you! ================================ It's time for the second meetup! This meetup is aimed at both beginners and people who have over 10 years of Git experience (wait a minute…). We hope to stretch your Gitability level, and better your understanding of version control systems! Programme: - \"Debugging with Git\": Ryan Dao Git is more than just a version control system. It's also one of the best debugging tools if used correctly. In this talk I'm going to show how Git and Delta Debugging can be used to help identify issues in your codebase. - \"Interactive rebasing with Git\": Jason Chionh In this short talk, we'll go through the command \"git rebase -i\". This is git rebasing in interactive mode. You can use it to organize local commit history. Specifically, we'll look at squashing many commits into one commit and re-ordering commits. - Lightning talk: \"Stashing, yo!\": Angelo Rohit - Lightning talk: \"Pull request, yo!\": Lian Hau Lee Come merge with your fellow Gits! Interested in speaking? Please talk to Sahil, Valentine or ChernJie! (We're looking for lightning talks!) Venue and food sponsor: Autodesk Asia (thanks guys!)
