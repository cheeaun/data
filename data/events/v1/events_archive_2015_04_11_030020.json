The Docker Project, the open platform for distributed applications, announced it will be organizing an open-source-a-thon where Docker core team members will teach and mentor people in how to contribute to open source. Contributions include code, documentation, tutorials, videos, and mentoring. Each contribution to the Docker Project will also support the Oceanic Society and its mission to conserve oceans. https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9TUPu8HhBrr7DIDpX1o96dkM3SpW0py7zmVwq6PpCFw807kV-huO0IOA4gCN3rnUf7ldUT8nG89c7xn8dUPkRczicz2Ep597ydj4BSfRabK3Z2J_oaIXUJ0JLeoY9Dsp_COhDxc The program is timed to coincide with the project’s 2nd birthday and is focused on a cause – ocean and marine life health – that is important to its millions of users. Docker’s logo, Moby Dock, is a blue whale that was contributed and selected by its community. The charitable program starts on March 23 and will span a total of five weeks; part of the proceeds will go towards the adoption and naming of a female blue whale soon to be known as “Molly Dock.” Contributions from the “opening week” of the program and follow-on contributions over the subsequent four weeks will be calculated and the final donation will be made. One contribution equates to a $50 donation, and an additional $50 will be added to the “Molly Dock fund” for those that wish to continue to contribute. As we get closer to the event, more information will be added to <a>docker.party </a>!
