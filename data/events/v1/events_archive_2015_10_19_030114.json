We will talk about HTML5 with ASP.NET 5. But will focus on the HTML5 itself. And let's do debugging with VorlonJS. HTML5 is very important topics, although ASP.NET 5 (by default) Razor is using HTML5, but some developers are tend to use HTML 4.x in that sense they just set the render mode to HTML5. So, we will share what is HTML5 and how to create forms properly in HTML5 and using the CSS, etc. And how to make the web renders okay with non modern browsers. The key is, don't detect the browsers, instead detect the features of the browsers. Please join this meetup so we can learn and share ASP.NET 5 using HTML5. Calling for speakers! All topics in ASP.NET 5 (Server side and Client Side). We got VorlonJS T-Shirts for those who wants to share VorlonJS topics.
