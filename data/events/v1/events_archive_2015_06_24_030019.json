It will be on Random Forests, and our speaker will be Toh Wei Zhong. About : Random Forests are built up from classification / regression trees. By randomly selecting predictors and creating an ensemble of trees (i.e. the forest), we are able to greatly increase the predictive capability of the method. In this talk, Wei Zhong will go into the details of the methodology, starting with the terminology all the way up to tuning the hyperparameters. We will end the workshop with a code walkthrough. About Wei Zhong: Wei Zhong is a graduate from the computational biology department at NUS. An ardent R user, he currently works as a data scientist at NCS.

Now that we’re rapidly approaching the second half of the year a lot of people have been contacting us keen to know how they can register. We’ve been really overwhelmed with interest and support from the whole APAC Community, so thank you for that. Here’s an overview of the current arrangements and plans Platinum Sponsor We are extremely pleased to announce officially that SAPIEN Technologies are going to be our platinum sponsor for this event! SAPIEN have long supported the PowerShell community and make some of the best tools on the market. With amazing folks like David Corales, Ferdinand Rios and June Blender, SAPIEN are hugely influential in the PowerShell community, we can't thank them enough for helping to make this event happen. SAPIEN will be present for both days and we look forward to welcoming them. If you can arrange to stay an extra day you’ll be able to experience the excitement of the Singapore F1 Grand Prix. What a way to wrap up the week! What about Registration?
