See you there! Free pizza is served before the talks. Unruly Creatures: The Web Platform at Dropbox Talk description Making websites is hard; possibly harder than it should be. None of {HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP} are well designed or smooth developer experiences. It's even harder when you have over a hundred engineers of varying levels of experience and commitment, working on a 500kloc shared project, with legacy code going back to 2007, without even a compiler to help you catch mistakes! This talk will cover the work we do on the Web Infrastructure team at Dropbox, about how we're using technology to help move the company forward. I'll cover the various ways in which we put code in your code to make the code that gets written better: abstraction, continuous integration and static analysis. Conventional and unconventional means that we use to move fast without breaking things. Speaker profile Haoyi is an engineer on the Web Infra and Developer Tools team who joined Dropbox after graduating in 2013. He likes functional programming and is the one person at Dropbox writing Scala full-time. Our Sponsors Friday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center and the Infocomm Development Authority.
