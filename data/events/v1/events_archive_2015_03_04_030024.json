We'll make it more approachable and easy for you! You may have heard about this thing called Kanban or you have have a friend or colleague who told you about it. And it may (or may not) sounds easy to implement at first. But how do you actually go about it? This workshop will give you an easy approach to start your first Kanban board! There won't be much theory (although I'll give pointers if you want them) - the central theme of this meetup is DOING! Sign up if you are interested in learning more about how to achieve outcomes and metrics that matter. This applies to people in all kinds of industries - eg. law firms or people working in HR! Soft drinks will be provided (courtesy of Microsoft). Contact me if you would like to sponsor pizza!
