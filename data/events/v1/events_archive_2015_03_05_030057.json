See you there! Free pizza is served before the talks. Unruly Creatures: The Web Platform at Dropbox Talk description Making websites is hard; possibly harder than it should be. None of {HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP} are well designed or smooth developer experiences. It's even harder when you have over a hundred engineers of varying levels of experience and commitment, working on a 500kloc shared project, with legacy code going back to 2007, without even a compiler to help you catch mistakes! This talk will cover the work we do on the Web Infrastructure team at Dropbox, about how we're using technology to help move the company forward. I'll cover the various ways in which we put code in your code to make the code that gets written better: abstraction, continuous integration and static analysis. Conventional and unconventional means that we use to move fast without breaking things. Speaker profile Haoyi is an engineer on the Web Infra and Developer Tools team who joined Dropbox after graduating in 2013. He likes functional programming and is the one person at Dropbox writing Scala full-time. Our Sponsors Friday Hacks is sponsored by the NUS Enterprise Center and the Infocomm Development Authority.

However, I regularly come across users who aren't aware that there are many ways to copy beyond the standard copy and paste command. Join me in this session and be amazed at the many more powerful ways that InDesign can help you duplicate stuff. Session 2 Ever wondered about editorial layouts and how we can fit copy into allocated text boxes or what are copy editing terms such as Rags, Widows and Orphans. Good typography requires a good sense of understanding about creating a copy layout with simple and easy to read columns. Some may be easily solved with InDesign, while others requires manual editing.

No problem! This is a half day event for complete beginners. Using recorded content from the Microsoft Virtual Academy and demonstrations from a PowerShell MVP and the User Group Leads, you'll finish the day much more confident with PowerShell than you were before. We have been hearing from the Community that there are not enough sessions for Beginners, also, some people are not confident about using PowerShell because they haven't had a good enough grounding in the fundamentals. We would like to address that. Using some amazing content on the Microsoft Virtual Academy by PowerShells creator Jeffrey Snover and PowerShell MVP Jason Helmick,we will cover some basics of PowerShell; using the shell, understanding Objects, mastering the Help system and understanding the Pipeline. These are core skills that once mastered will help you advance faster along your PowerShell journey. This session will be delivered using Videos from the MVA, group discussions, demos by the group leads and hands on. It is important to bring your own laptop, as the intended outcome of this is to build confidence through your own hands-on experience. You can find the MVA content that we will follow at http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/getting-started-with-powershell-3-0-jump-start . It is recommended that you watch Video 01 before the day as preparation. We will cover videos 2 to 5 together on the day and any more if time allows. Following this session you can finish the MVA course on your own time or join us for another session in March to finish, if you prefer the group interaction. Please remember this is for Complete Beginners and all content will be at that level, though Intermediate folks may learn some tips and tricks along the way also. See you there!

From Silicon Valley to Silicon Straits, this humble material has become synonymous with high-tech enterprise driven by the ever increasing computation power and shrinking size of CMOS processors. However, transistors cannot simply keep getting smaller (the characteristic size of CMOS transistors is now only 60 atoms wide). At these scales, the bizarre laws of quantum mechanics come into play: electrons can be in two places at once (called ‘superposition), and can ‘tunnel’ through barriers. Controlling electrons at these scales becomes a bit like herding (Schrödinger) cats, making it impossible to build basic computing components. Chip designers today have been using all their ingenuity to fend off this ‘quantum limit’ for a few more years with novel designs, but reaching the limit is inevitable. Instead of trying to work around these troublesome quantum effects, it is possible to build an entirely new type of computer whose operation fundamentally relies on quantum features such as superposition. There are a wide range of different technologies being explored to build such a ‘quantum computer’, including arrays of trapped ions addressed by lasers, and circuits of superconducting aluminium kept a few thousands of a degree above absolute zero. Recent results from laboratories around the world suggest that silicon could in fact provide a platform for such quantum processors - this include superposition states that last for 3 hours, or being able to measure individual dopant atoms in silicon nano-devices. We still have a little way to go before silicon can be considered to be on an equal footing with other quantum computing designs, but this isn’t the first time silicon has played catch-up. After all, lead sulfide and germanium were used to make transistors before high-purity silicon and CMOS technology came along. So far, we have every reason to think that silicon will survive the next big computational leap, from the classical to the quantum age. \n  \nJohn Morton studies the coherent control of electron and nuclear spins in solid state materials and devices, with a focus on quantum technologies. Quantum technologies are ones which exploit quantum superposition and entanglement to achieve major advances over current technologies in areas including communication, sensing and information processing. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nThis event is organised by the Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore in partnership with the Science Centre Singapore.","location":"Science Centre Singapore, , 15 Science Centre Rd, Singapore 609081","url":"http://cqt.eventbrite.sg/?aff=ebapi","group_name":"Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizers/2560122282/","formatted_time":"25 Mar 2015, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2015-03-25T11:00:00Z","end_time":"2015-03-25T12:30:00Z"},{"id":"1559021821042963","name":"ArtScience Late","description":" One Thursday a month, 7pm to 10pm 2015:time:space: By Robert Casteels 8pm and 9pm Expression Gallery, Level 4 2015:time:space: is a collaborative work of voices, electronic instruments, live processing, tape and video.

In order to manage the business well, the manager needs to use the data to answer the many questions that management is interested in. And also to help them make better decisions to increase productivity and sales, and to improve their customers' experience. \nFor example, management may be interested in, “Who is likely to be a guest at the hotel and why?”, or “What is the average daily rate per room?”, or “What is the vacancy rate of the hotel?” \nThere are many analytical techniques that can answer these business questions. Techniques in “Predictive Analytics”, “Channel Distribution Optimisation”, “Customer Analytics”, “Recommendation Systems”, and others. \nWe have invited hospitality experts to tell us how digital analytics can help managers: \n\nDetermine who are their guests and profile them\nUnderstand why guests choose their hotel/airline/restaurant/services\nDetermine guest satisfaction with their services\nWhich guests rate their services highly and how to improve guest satisfaction\nTo design  more effective digital strategy campaigns\nPerform comparative analysis among hotels \nBetter understand the competitive landscape.\n\n The hospitality industry is extremely competitive. Managers need to be more proactive in their decision making or their competitors will soon beat them at their own game and become the new leaders in the industry. \nThe use of digital analytics is growing in the hospitality industry.
