And, our whole team is involved in making sure you start with a blast and make awesome stuff happen! Please read the FAQ on our continually broken/changing site and GET IN TOUCH if you or someone you know might be interested. \n--------> \nDrinks on us. That's right: free beer/(possibly wine)/water. \n \nHackerNest Tech Socials are a fun, relaxed way to connect with your local tech brethren. Atmosphere: chill, friendly, unpretentious, agenda-free (no sales pitch, yo), and brimming with UltraSmart(TM) people. \nWe believe that strong, supportive tech communities should exist everywhere - not just in hotspots like San Francisco and New York. In 2011, we started running Tech Socials in Toronto, where our monthly attendance grew to over 350+ technologists literally 100% from word-of-mouth. \nThe typical Tech Social schedule: \n- 6:30pm: folks arrive, grab drinks, socialize   - 7:00pm: quick intro, thank sponsors, quick announcements   - 7:10pm: back to chatting with interesting new friends   - 9:00pm: go home exhausted from great conversations \nSponsors make this growing movement possible - email us to chat! \nVenue: \nZopim: Talk to your customers in real time \n \nWanna show off your office? We're always looking for big open spaces with 50+ (standing room) capacity that are easily accessible. \nAbout Us: \nHackerNest is an international nonprofit uniting local tech communities through unpretentious Tech Socials and hackathons. We cram lots of smart, accomplished people into a room with free drinks. Our relaxed, down-to-earth events attract a diverse and highly technical membership.

Staying true to the amorphic definition of “creative coding”, our presenters will be span the spectrum of topics. George Gally http://radarboy.com/george/ is [ironcially] a coding denier/artist, and is enthusiastic about a wide range of artistics expressions dominated by technology and real world analogue interactions. George will be touching upon the topic of motion and audio reactive in Javascript. Daniel Wessolek http://danielwessolek.com/port/ works as a research associate in Interaction Design at Bauhaus University Weimar. His research currently focuses on glowing matter, open design and civil engagement. Cedric Honnet http://www.hackster.io/cedric spent most of his life tinkering with music and computers. He studied engineering but kept exploring arts and interactivity. Cedric will share some of the tricks he discovered while collaborating with artists in France, Colombia, California and in Singapore.

What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss. ----------------- Original Meetup : http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love Papers Repo : https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love Code of Conduct : https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md","location":"HackerspaceSG","url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/868597839850451","group_name":"Papers We Love Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/1535170340032623","formatted_time":"13 Apr 2015, Mon, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2015-04-13T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-04-13T13:30:00.000Z"},{"id":"221694547","name":"Coding Dojo Continued","description":"New Dojo, same problem. https://github.com/SingaporeScalaProgrammers/gokata Hopefully this time we will get on to the juicy bits towards the end.
