Culturing cells in vitro under perfusion conditions simulates this mechanical stimulus and induces a more physiological behavior. Besides the simulation of shear stress, the control of other environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH and oxygen are crucial for long-term cultivation and imaging of living cells. ibidi’s research is aimed on integrating cell culture with high-end microscopy as well as the development of functional cell based assays such as migration, chemotaxis, angiogenesis. In this seminar, the focus will be on perfusion assays and the biological impact of shear stress on cells. Scientific applications and results from this field will be presented. \nDetails \n26 Mar 2015 (Thu), 2pm - 3pm  National University of Singapore,  Mechanobiology Institute, T-Lab Building  Level 5 Meeting Room  \nRefreshments will be served. \nSpeaker \nDr. Tina Freisinger  Application Specialist  ibidi \nTina Freisinger studied Biology in Munich and Edinburgh and pursued a PhD with a focus on cell biology and imaging at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich.

This time it'll be on the 26th of March at the ThoughtWorks' office. Venue: 87B Amoy Street #03/04, Singapore 069906, Singapore We're still looking for one more 10-15 minute talk, if you're interested please contact us! PyCon Singapore is going to be June 17th to 19th and the call for proposals is up on the website, if you have something to share then please sign up! https://pycon.sg/proposals/ -------------- Talks 1. \"Getting started with testing using Pytest and Mock\" by Gabe Hollombe. Pytest is a great alternative testing framework to unittest from the standard library. It often lets you get the same tests written with far fewer lines of code, and it has a cool dependency injection system to help you share common test dependencies while keeping your tests understandable. I'll tell you all about how to get basic unit testing done, and I'll show you how to use Voidspace's Mock library to test collaborations between your objects, too. Gabe is a full-stack senior engineer at Neo Innovation, with a thirst for knowledge and a passion for sharing what he's learned. He's had the pleasure of speaking on four different continents about JavaScript, Ruby, Vim, and HTML5 Game development. 2. \"Developing real time applications in Django with Websockets \" by Gerald Goh Utilising swampdragon , I'll be showing how to build a simple real time chat application in Django. Gerald is a full stack developer at Apvera Pte. Ltd., a security analytics startup. 3. \"How to learn and be productive with Python3 in a week\" by Chris Chris will talk about how you can go from knowing nothing of Python to being productive in a week. • Basic Python syntax and environment setup ( IDE, virtualenv ) • Data type • How to use libraries 4. \"Three Python tips\" by Martin Brochhaus We are hoping to repeat this talk with different speakers at the end of each meetup. Martin will make the start and give quick introductions to three basic Python tools that will make your life easier: * Virtualenv * Virtualenvwrapper * Flake8 Martin is the founder of Bitmazk Pte. Ltd., a Singapore based web development agency specialized on creating web apps with Python and Django. He is also part of the organizing committee for PyCon Singapore and an active member of Python User Group Singapore. 5. Alfred from PyCon APAC will talk about the upcoming APAC conference in Taiwan. -------------- Would you like to speak at this or a future meetups? You could share about your technology stack, how you solved a problem, your new library, or your opinions on best practices, so that people can get to know how awesome you are! 5 Python tips is a small segment at the end of meetup where you can share some things that make your Python life easier. A newly discovered core module, a library or some command line tool that makes your life better and/or easier. So don't be shy! Step forward and share your knowledge! For speaking please contact Björn, @gaqzi or <ba@sanitarium.se>, or Victor <icyisamu@gmail.com> See you all soon! -------------- Job Postings Are you looking for Pythonista? Do you have a job posting? Email us a blurb (< 50 words) + link and we'll put it here. -------------- A big thank you to our venue sponsor ThoughtWorks!
