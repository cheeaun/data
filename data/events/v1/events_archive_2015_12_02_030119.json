Description: You’re developing your mobile App on Bluemix but don’t know how to migrate your App for production or you are just wondering how to deploy mobile applications on SoftLayer? Then come to our second SoftLayer Startup Meeting on December 2nd  6:00 pm @Blk71. We’ll show you how to migrate from Bluemix to Softlayer as well as a hands-on perspective on how to deploy secure web application architectures on Cloud. This will be surrounded by snacks, drinks and refreshments as well as interaction with IBMs Tech Mentors in one to one discussions.

Get Excited--It's Big!","description":" We are holding the December BigData/HadoopSG meetup in conjunction with the first Strata + Hadoop World ever held in Asia. We're taking advantage of the speakers that will be in town and have some really, really great speakers.  Doug Cutting (the Father of Hadoop!) will be talking about \"From MapReduce to Spark: An Ecosystem Evolves\" Abstract: Apache Hadoop was the first software to permit affordable use of petabytes. In the decade since, many other projects have been created around Hadoop's HDFS storage layer and its MapReduce processing engine, forming a rich software ecosystem. Apache Spark now provides a second generation processing engine which greatly improves on Hadoop's MapReduce. Most new applications will now use Spark in place of MapReduce. This transition provides an example of an evolutionary pattern in the data ecosystem that gives it long-term strength. Ted Dunning, Chief Architect at MapR ,Guru of Everything Scalable, Co-Author of Mahout in Action and Noted Beer Drinker. \"How Document Databases Simplify Database Design\" He will walk though how a real world database can be restructured using nested data structures resulting in a much simpler design that achieves high performance and scalability and is much easier to understand than the original. In addition, He will show how the resulting database can be queried using SQL tools such as Apache Drill, or using API’s in Python, Javascript and Java. Regunath Balasubramanian (Chief Architect at Flipkart) and Sharad Agrawal (\"All Things Data\" at Flipkart, Apache Hadoop and Apache Lens PMC member, organiser of Hadoop Bangalore Meetup) will be talking on Migrating Data Across Databases. Abstract: Flipkart recently migrated data centers and underwent a very large and complex database migration exercise. Regu and Sharad will share their experiences and lessons learned.  The event will be held at the Strata conference area at Suntec, rooms 321-322.","location":"Suntec Convention Center, Suntec Convention Center, Singapore","latitude":1.293369,"longitude":103.857987,"rsvp_count":366,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/BigData-Hadoop-SG/events/226577138/","group_id":8165752,"group_name":"BigData.SG & Hadoop.SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/BigData-Hadoop-SG","formatted_time":"02 Dec 2015, Wed, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2015-12-02T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-12-02T13:30:00.000Z"}]}
